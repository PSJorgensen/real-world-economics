#### Importance of economic dynamics for the earth system and global sustainability

-   Human economic activitiy has a deciding role for the future of our
    planet. Yet some may argue that economics out of the three pillars
    of sustainability development - the social, the economic and the
    environmental - is the pillar least integrated in current approach
    to sustainability science.

-   The human economy is a driving factor of biodiversity loss and
    climate change. At the same time, global economic inequalities
    themselves can be viewed as one of the greatet barriers for
    addressing global environmental and socio-economic challenges.

-   At the same time Growth in human population and the economy are two
    trends that epitomizes the current environmental challenges of
    biodiversity loss and climate change and improvementes in living
    standards in many countries that have undergone economic growth in
    the 20th and 21st century. Associated with these trends is the
    dilemmas of global equity on a finite planet, including the question
    of whether countries with large economic prosperity need to consume
    less to allow the developing countries to achieve similar living
    standards.

-   In this context, understanding how the economy is linksed to the
    environment and to social aspects of society is of foundational
    importance for the science of global sustainability.

-   It is therefore concerning that scientific fields of the three
    pillars of sustainability are still only connected to a very limited
    extent. In particular, the field of economics and finance remains
    the pillar most poorly addressed by sustainability science
    [**REF**]. This is of great concern for the prospects of sustainable
    development guided by sound advice from the scientific community.

-   To address the need to integrate economics and finance better with
    sustainability science, in this Sustainability Science perspective
    we highlight two areas of importance:

    1.  recent advances in integrating economics into
        sustainability-oriented sciences.

    2.  major gaps for integrating economic into sustainability-oriented
        sciences.

<br><br>

#### A brief history of sustainability science - what concepts has been important for SS

-   Sustainability science emerged as a unified discipline in the
    beginning of the 21st century (Bettencourt and Kaur 2011). Before
    and after its unification, contributions to sustainability science
    has mainly come from three broad fields, the social sciences,
    engineering and the biological sciences (Bettencourt and Kaur 2011).

-   Contributions from these fields have mainly come from a small number
    of disciplinary clusters. For example, contributions from
    engineering has mainly come from systems and complex engineering and
    research. Contributions from the biological sciences have mainly
    come from the field of ecology with contributions to bidodiversity
    and ecosystem services. Similarly in the social sciences,
    contributions have not been evenly distributed across the field.

-   *Maybe describe more here some of the important concepts of
    sustainability science - but may be too redundant for the type of
    article.*

-   The contribution of the social sciences has remained fairly constant
    over time, but increased slightly since the unification in 2003
    (Bettencourt and Kaur 2011).

-   *Key papers* \* Future challenges, Charles Perrings PNAS 2007 \*
    "Although both economics and ecology are still full of examples of
    disciplinary myopia, the integration of the disciplines through such
    ventures has generated more flexible and adaptive solution to both
    the management and the science of common-pool environmenta resources
    (12, 13). " \* Evolution of sustainability science \* Beyond

<br><br>

#### History of economics and sustainability science - what generally characterizes the research questions that have been taken up?

-   Sustainability science has been succesful in addressing a number of
    economic issues. These include the interactions between the natural
    resource base and human income, such as Sub-saharan African
    exceptionalism in world poverty and the role of deprived natural
    resources, ethnic diversity, inequality and institutions in keeping
    many people caught in a "poverty trap" (Kates and Dasgupta 2007).
    Another area of economics that have been advanced by sustainability
    science is the operationalization of ecosystem services (or natural
    capital) valuation (Daily and Matson 2008), both through national
    statistical accounting schemes [MÃ¤ler, Aniyar, and Jansson (2008)},
    now mandated by the OECD under the termninology of green accounts,
    and, through on-the-ground ecosystem service based governance
    through actions spanning from the community level (Cowling et al.
    2008) to the national level (Liu et al. 2008).

-   The above two examples serve to illustrate that sustainability
    science' occupation with economics has mainly followed **two**
    pathways. (1) The role of disparity and central mode of human income
    and its interactions with the environmental system and the social
    effects it brings with though complex feedback loops. (2) Valuation
    of earths natural capital and operationalizing local and national
    governance schemes of these assets.

<br><br>

#### History of economic and sustainability science - what generally characterizes some of the research questions that hasn't been taken up?

-   Other economics-related research questions have barely been
    addressed by sustainability science (\*at least when judging by the
    content published in the xxx number of articles under the
    sustainability science label in PNAS). Some of the most notable
    areas of omission appears to be the role of international licit and
    illicit financial capital flows and trade for sustainable
    development, and the role of financing and key-financial players in
    ensuring democractic or other political sustainablity transitions.

-   Is this because sustainability science is naive to the role of money
    in decision making?
    -   We can not rule out this explanation, however sustainability
        science has dealt with issues of corruption in e.g. developing
        countries.
-   Is this because these branches of research are less well developed
    in economics and finance?
    -   Doesn't seem likely since sustainability science has taken on
        other areas of research that have only recently emerged or been
        limited to small communities.

<br><br>

#### Recent history of decreasing diveristy of economics and relations to other disciplines in terms of sustainability related questions

-   The fields of economics and finance research have changed over time.
    In particular, recent contributions document how the economical
    sciences during the 20th century underwent a continuing decrease in
    the diversity of research questions and methods being used (Colander
    2005).

-   *What about the recent history of finance research? Find some
    references to document this.*

-   Recently, and partially fuelled by the financial crises of the 21st
    century. There has been a concerted effort to re-energize the field
    of economics with a return to a more diverse set of approaches and
    questions. It remains to be shown, however, if the recent changing
    dynamics of economics research will also lead to an uptake of
    sustainability related questions.

-   In recent decades many of the economical questions most pertinent
    for global sustainability have been addressed in communities that
    are only tangentially connected to the core fo economics research
    and in some cases arguably more closely connected to sustainability
    science. These include, the investigation of the material foundation
    and material limits to economic growth (club of rome ref, Brown et
    al. 2014; Burger et al. 2012; Burnside et al. 2012), the valuation
    of natural capital [Costanza and Daily refs], the global structure
    of the economy (M. Lenzen et al. 2012), the impact of economic
    activies, such as trade, on the environment and vice versa [natural
    resources refs],**xxx**, **xxx**, **xxx**.

-   In the meantime, sustainability science must actively seek to
    integrate with those communities that address questions of economics
    and finance most pertinent to global sustainability.

-   \*Mention somewhere that the economical sciences have gone through a
    phase of decreasing diversity. A diversity that is now returning
    following the prolonged financial crises of the United States and
    Europe. Sustainability science can play an important role in
    maintaining this diversity by more fully integrating with some of
    the emerging branches of research.

Two advances in integrating the earth system in economic accounting
-------------------------------------------------------------------

<br><br>

### Greener economic accounting for natural capital

#### History of the ecosystem services and natural capital concept

-   The ecosystem services and natural capital concepts evolved out of
    other related concepts in the 1980's linked to the "land economy"
    and were mainstreamed in particular through the Millennium Ecosystem
    Assessment published in 2005 (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005).
    From a historical perspective (GÃ³mez-Baggethun et al. 2010) "the
    trend towards monetization and commodification of ecosystem services
    is partly the result of a slow move from the original economic
    conception of nature's benefits as use values in Classical economics
    to their conceptualization in terms of exchange values in
    Neoclassical economics". This trend has led to debate over whether
    the use of the concept in its current form would stall aims of
    conservationists (Norgaard 2010; Norgaard 2008). The contrary
    argument sees the benefit of co-existence and exchange between a
    diversity of concepts and approaches, including both traditional
    biodiversity conservationist and newer ecosystem service or natural
    capital based apparoaches (Tallis et al. 2008; Reyers, Polasky,
    Tallis, and Mooney 2012; Reyers, Polasky, Tallis, Mooney, et al.
    2012). The main feature of the inclusivity argument is that the
    diversity of concepts are needed to interact with as many
    stakeholders as possible for the parrallel pursuit of conservation
    and enviornmentally sustainable economic development (Tallis and
    Lubchenco 2014).

Gomez-Baggethun (GÃ³mez-Baggethun et al. 2010) in her review concludes
that the focus on monetary valuation and payment schemes related to the
ecosystem services and natural capital communities has indeed
contributed to attract political support for conservation. At the same
time "*a growing number of ecosystem services may have been commidified
and the Neoclassical economics paradigm and the market logic to tackle
environmental problems*" amplified.

-   Payments for ecosystem services [e.g. Kelsey Jack et al. 2008 PNAS]

#### Global economic dynamics in natural capital and ecosystem services

-   In 2014 (Costanza, Groot, et al. 2014) estimated the annual monetary
    loss of ecosystem services from land use change between 1997 and
    2011 to range between 4.3 to 20.2 trillion USD.

#### Recent impact of the ecosystem services and natural capital concept

-   A lot of progress has been made since the inception of ecosystem
    services valuation in the *XXXX*. Notable progress, includes the
    inception of the Intergovenrnmental Platform on Biodiversity and
    Ecosystem Services (DÃ­az et al. 2015). Political attention to global
    sustainability and the unsustainable dynamics of current
    measurements of economic growth has facilitated international
    research progress on integrated measures of growth, such as the
    Genuine Progress Indicator (Costanza, Kubiszewski, et al. 2014).
    Such integrated indicators of social, environmental and economic
    progress are now being suggested as indicators for the UN
    Sustainable Development Goals (Costanza, Kubiszewski, et al. 2014).
    In 2015 all OECD countries will adopt mandated green accounting
    systems (**REF**). The InVest tool developed to incorporate natural
    capital into decisions, is now *GIVE EXAMPLES OF NOTABLE USE*.

<br><br>

### Telecoupled dynamics of global trade

-   Leontief 1970 envisioned national accounting as a way of measuring
    the impact of economic activities and human consumption on the
    environment. With recent progress in accounting for resource use in
    globalized production and consumption chains using global
    multi-regional input-output models (MRIOs) to link together resource
    extraction, import, consumption and exports in national accounts
    (Manfred Lenzen et al. 2012, Lenzen et al. (2013), Lenzen et al.
    (2014)). Early phases of that vision is now being implemented in a
    number of ways. By associating the MRIO with enviromental and social
    variables (so-called satellite variables), environmentally and
    socially extended MRIOs are produced that allow to assess the
    environmental and social interlinked impacts of global ecnomomic
    activity (e.g. Wiedmann et al. 2013, M. Lenzen et al. (2012);
    Marques et al. 2012).

-   Early assesssments of long-standing economic hypotheses such as the
    Environmental Kuznets Curve and the paradigm of relative and
    absolute decoupling have been compromised by not acccounting for
    resources used in foreign contributes in the production of
    commodities consumed domestically. Still challenged a need to
    interpolate large amounts of missing data, the model provides a
    significant advancement in order for sustainability scientists to
    assess the degree to which relative and absolute decoupling is being
    reach in the globalized economy Wiedmann 2012, whether an
    Environmental Kuznets Curce really does exist, assess the domestic
    economic, environmental and health impact of pollution attributed to
    commodities that are being consumed in foreign countires (Marques et
    al. 2012), and similar how global trade drives biodiversity threats
    in the developing countries (M. Lenzen et al. 2012). One of the
    latest applications of this methodological advance will be a dataset
    on the value added to national economies by trade to be released by
    the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
    (<http://unctad.org/>). The dataset provides a new opportunity to
    assess and evaluate **...XXX**. These assessments have fundamental
    value for sustainability science as they answer basic questions
    about future paths for human development and the sustainability of
    current economic paradigms.

            together with global economic inequality largely explains

        -   A special issue on the African poverty trap in PNAS (Kates

            contributes to keep countries trapped in poverty (Collier

AREAS THAT NEED ATTENTION
=========================

<br><br>

### Finance in politics, financial players an dynamcis

<br><br>

#### Role of finance in preventing democracy and implications sustainable transitions

\*A study from 2014 have documented how the role of campaign financing
in US politics may lead to in-validation of long held theories of
political science, such as the median voter theorem (Gilens and Page
2014). Similar ongoing studies are documenting how the probability of
getting elected is correlated with the amount of campaing funds raised
[**Cite Tom Ferguson research**]. The regulated earns more than the
regulator and this financial inequality may present some moral
challenges for sound decision-making in regulators (Ferguson and Johnson
2010).

\*Such questions are of clear interested to sustainabliity science and
research on global sustainablity. For example, what are the implications
for the likelihood of sustainability transitions? If decision makers
make choice in the interest of their financiers instead of in the
interest of their electorate, may this either increase or decrease the
likelihood and speed of sustainablity transitions wanted by the
electorate?

<br><br>

#### Impact of ownership structures and financial corporations on global sustainability (key players)

-   A recent study have documented that a small number of financial
    institutions play an important role in linking the global economy
    together (Vitali and Battiston 2013). What are the implications for
    global sustainability of such hyper connectivity?. Can the concepts
    of key-stone species, for example, be transferred to financial
    capital holders, and does this concept also apply to the
    socio-environmental effects of actions taking by the financial
    actors. Ongoing research are just starting to investigate such
    questions in the marine realm [*get Calle, JB and other SRC folks to
    fill in here*]. Similar research could be taken on in the
    agricultural and silvicultural realms with regard to land-use change
    etc.

-   **Fertilizer prices** is one case where prices may be controlled by
    a cartel-like ownership structure and could be a terrestrial model
    for the key-financial actors model (**Christopher Gilbert GEDB
    seminar 150424**). **(Ott 2012)** "Torero (2011) examines the market
    structure and shows that the fertilizer industry is a global one
    with a high level of concentration." \*\*(Hernandez and Torero
    2011): "The results of the study indicate that the fertilizer
    industry is a global market with high levels of concentration and
    increasing trade. The top five countries control more than 50
    percent of the world's production capacity for all major fertilizer
    products. There is also a high level of concentration at the country
    level among the major producing countries, except for China. The
    high and increasing levels of trade in the industry are evident from
    the higher dependence of several regions on imported fertilizer."
    "*It appears that despite the high levels of concentration in the
    industry, prices are even higher in further concentrated markets due
    to the apparent greater market power enjoyed by a couple of firms*."

<br><br>

#### The global impact of investments and market dynamics

-   The great recession of 2008 and the prolonged recession in Europe
    have been two of the most influential events on western hemisphere
    policy in the 21st century. Both recessions were partially caused by
    the influence of increasingly complex financial system on commodity
    prices such as housing prices and even national savings (Greece)
    [find articles on investment in the national savings of Greece,
    Italy and Spain **REFS**]. The impact of the following economic
    downturn on important environmental policies such as energy
    investments can be seen e.g. in many nations decision to explore
    options for liquified shale oil and natural gas and lowered
    ambitions in national and supra-national plans of transitioning to
    renewable energy sources [**REF**].

-   Increasing investment in food commodities from index investors in
    2007 may have exacerbaed the spikes in food prices in 2008 and 2011
    and consequently had a role in the social unrest that these price
    rises helped unleash (**Christopher Gilbert GEDB seminar 150424 -
    Index investor activity increased before price spikes**).

-   The integration of financial market dynamics and complexity with
    sustainability science seems an important agenda to ensure a more
    resilient and holistic response to such events.

-   Examples of remaining research questions with regard to the
    financial crisis are:

    -   What have socio-environmental impacts been of the fincial crisis
        on other continents?

    -   Can key trends in environmental and social degradation or
        improvement be traced to events relating to the financial
        crisis.

    -   How do other actors respond to financial crisis. Do they e.g.
        learn to anticipate negative impacts from prolonge recessions
        caused by financial market complexity?

<br><br>

### International financial transactions and flows

<br><br>

#### Social and enviromental impact of financial transactions

-   With increasing complexity of financial markets, impacts of capital
    flows are in a manner similar to impacts of production and
    consumption in globalized supply chains becoming harder to track.
    Are international financial transactions playing important roles in
    determining social and environmental outcomes in regions where they
    flow from, through and end-up. Are these outcomes positive or
    negative for global sustainablity?

<br><br>

#### Social and enviornmental impact of illicit financial transactions

-   While captial flows of the financial market may prove an important
    factor influencing the likelihood of sustainable transitions, much
    of international trade happens outside the market. For example, the
    international market for wildlife medicine largely occur through
    illicit financial transactions. Such markets and transactions may in
    some cases have more immediately obvious impact on
    socio-environemntal sustainablity. For example, the negative impact
    of such trading on threatened species, sometimes appearing on the
    brnk of extinction, is well-documented through declines in e.g.
    elephants and rhinos in Africa. Tragically, from trophy hunting it
    has been shown that increasing rarity of hunted species may only
    increase the exclusiveness, price and demand for their derived
    products - potentially leading to a self-reinforcing feedback loop
    toward further decline (Palazy et al. 2011; Palazy et al. 2012). In
    other cases, the effect of illicit international capital flows are
    much less well documented. **give examples** Thus, whether licit or
    illicit, untangling the teleconnected socio-environmental effects of
    international capital flows should be of priority to sustainability
    science.

<br><br>

### Financial innovation for sustainabiltiy

<br><br>

#### Innovation of investments for sustainability

-   Non-governmental financial investments are playing an increasing
    role in addressing concerns related to social and environmental
    sustainaiblity, in the developing as well as the developed world
    [**REF**]. Philanthropy has played a role in ensuring environmental,
    social and economic sustainability for centuries. Associated with
    the increase in the role of private investments has been an
    increasing diversification of types of investments for
    sustainability [**REF**]. From the well-known micro-financing
    strategies [**REF**] to green bond markets and other types of
    investment for impact [**REF**].

-   Sustainability science needs to embrace these recent developments by
    asking a number of research and solution-oriented questions: (1) How
    effective are private financial investments in ensuring positive
    sustainability-related outcomes, compared to, for example,
    governnmental investments?; (2) Which types of private financial
    investments are most effective in various geographical areas and in
    solving different sustainability-challenges.

#### Notes on integration

-   Emphasis on need to fully integrate economics and finance into
    sustainability science.

-   The current state of sustainability science or (environmental,
    social and economic sciences) is ripe with example of lack of
    integration.

    -   Examples of lack of integration between ecological, social and
        economic perspectives:

    -   Lack of integration of an explicitly ecological perspective into
        social sciences and socio-economic policy (Brown et al. 2014,
        Burnside et al. (2012))
        -   With the implication of overlooking natural resource

#### INTRO

The concept of capital is important to sustainability science and
environmental conservation

-   The concept of capital, a term borrowed from economics, is
    foundational for sustainability science. Natural, social and
    financial capital distinguishes between the assets possess in
    currencies of environmental, societal and monetary value. This is
    one example of an important interplay between sustainability science
    and economics where sustainability science has adopted central
    concepts of economics. Sustainability science is addressing some
    research areas of economics

-   Sustainability science has begun to address the interplay between
    economic dynamics/sustainability and socio-environmental
    sustainability. Examples include, (1) the influence of economic
    inequality on environmental sustainability, (2) the measurement of
    economic growth integrating measures of financial capital with
    social and natural capital.

Sustainability science has been slower to pick up other central lines of
economic research \* However, many central areas of economics has yet to
make into integrated sustainability research. These include, (1) the
influence of money in politics and how they influence democratic
transitions toward sustainability, (2) how international monetary
transactions and illicit capital flows influence social and
environmental outcomes at their destinations and to what extent this
tele-couples econo-socio-environmental dynamics in areas fare apart.

#### Main body

-   Green accounting (progress, next steps)

-   Inequality and environmental, social and financial sustainability

-   The role of money in facilitating or slowing down democratic
    transformations toward sustainability

Perspective \* From green accounting to national accounts revisions

#### Title:

*Blind spots: Gaps and recent progress in linking real world economics
and sustainability science*

<br><br>

#### Tenet:

Sustainability science has made good progress in showing the
environmental and social effects and limits to current resource use.
Yet, the field has had what can best be described as a "blind spot" to
the impacts of capital and so-called real world economics on the
environmental and social aspects of sustainability.

<br><br>

#### Format suggestions:

A comment or perspective piece, e.g. for PNAS sustainability science
section, or some more realistic target journal. The piece would comment
on and highlight recent progress and future potential for stronger
integration of real world economics into sustainability science.

Four topics to highlight as gaps or areas of recent progress Remaining
gaps

-   The influence of capital in governance on environmental issues

-   International financial flows and consequences for democracy and the
    environment Areas of recent progress?

-   The environmental and social sustainability of income distributions
    (an area of progress?)

-   Macroeconomic indicators (an area of progress?)

<br><br>

**The influence of finance in environmental decision making**

Main argument: Democracy as a cornerstone in a future Anthropocene that
is just, fair and sustainable.

Research questions: Do elected representatives represent the electorate
and the environment? What is the role of vested interest in
environmental policy?

Research needs: Studies looking at voting behaviour of elected
representatives on environmental issues in relation to campaign
financing and total amounts of raised capital and public opinion etc.

<br><br>

**Illicit financial flows - hidden connections to democracy and the
environment?**

Research questions: What is the role of financial flows in and out of
countries in affecting foundational aspects of a sustainable future?

1.  Do international investment/money laundering affect aspects of
    democracy and thus opportunities for sustainability?

2.  What are the direct and indirect impacts of international financial
    flows? Are they captured by analysis of commodity flows and supply
    chain/life cycle analysis?

-   Datasets on financial flows (illicit financial flows
    report/database, Garry has database )

<br><br>

**Sustainable income distributions (an area of recent progress?)**

*Research question:*

Which (post-transfer) income distributions are most sustainable in terms
of environment (and other aspects of human wellbeing)?

Recent progress:

Happiness and inequality studies?

GDP growth and inequality studies (does GDP growth increase inequality
while decreasing ecosystem and human well-being?)

What are unaddressed gaps here?

<br><br>

*Resources:*

Garry Peterson publications in PLoS One and Conservation Biology.

What are other important resources Garry?

<br><br>

**The sustainability of macroeconomic indicators (an area of
progress?)**

Aim of section: Highlighting progress in reforming macroeconomic
indicators of growth to include ecoysytem services and human well-being.
Research question: I'm not sure what the area for sustainability science
is her

Basically I guess this section could be a description of the many known
undesirable environmental and societal effects of a pure GDP growth
based focus and an analysis of science' role in current progress in
changing the policy agenda.
