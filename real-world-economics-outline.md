-   **Importance of economic dynamics for the earth system and global
    sustainability**

    -   Human economic activitiy has a deciding role for the future of
        our planet. Yet some may argue that economics out of the three
        pillars of sustainability development - the social, the economic
        and the environmental - is the pillar least integrated in
        current approach to sustainability science.

    -   The human economy is a driving factor of biodiversity loss and
        climate change. At the same time, global economic inequalities
        themselves can be viewed as one of the greatet barriers for
        addressing global environmental and socio-economic challenges.

    -   At the same time Growth in human population and the economy are
        two trends that epitomizes the current environmental challenges
        of biodiversity loss and climate change and improvementes in
        living standards in many countries that have undergone economic
        growth in the 20th and 21st century. Associated with these
        trends is the dilemmas of global equity on a finite planet,
        including the question of whether countries with large economic
        prosperity need to consume less to allow the developing
        countries to achieve similar living standards.

    -   In this context, understanding how the economy is linksed to the
        environment and to social aspects of society is of foundational
        importance for the science of global sustainability.

    -   It is therefore concerning that scientific fields of the three
        pillars of sustainability are still only connected to a very
        limited extent. In particular, the field of economics and
        finance remains the pillar most poorly addressed by
        sustainability science [**REF**]. This is of great concern for
        the prospects of sustainable development guided by sound advice
        from the scientific community.

    -   To address the need to integrate economics and finance better
        with sustainability science, in this Sustainability Science
        perspective we highlight two areas of importance:

        1.  recent advances in integrating economics into
            sustainability-oriented sciences.
        2.  major gaps for integrating economic into
            sustainability-oriented sciences.

-   **A brief history of sustainability science - what concepts has been
    important for SS**

    -   Sustainability science emerged as a unified discipline in the
        beginning of the 21st century (L. M. A. Bettencourt and Kaur
        2011). Before and after its unification, contributions to
        sustainability science has mainly come from three broad fields,
        the social sciences, engineering and the biological sciences (L.
        M. A. Bettencourt and Kaur 2011).

    -   Contributions from these fields have mainly come from a small
        number of disciplinary clusters. For example, contributions from
        engineering has mainly come from systems and complex engineering
        and research. Contributions from the biological sciences have
        mainly come from the field of ecology with contributions to
        bidodiversity and ecosystem services. Similarly in the social
        sciences, contributions have not been evenly distributed across
        the field.

    -   *Maybe describe more here some of the important concepts of
        sustainability science - but may be too redundant for the type
        of article.*

    -   The contribution of the social sciences has remained fairly
        constant over time, but increased slightly since the unification
        in 2003 (L. M. A. Bettencourt and Kaur 2011).

        -   *Key papers*
            -   Future challenges, Charles Perrings PNAS 2007
                -   "Although both economics and ecology are still full
                    of examples of disciplinary myopia, the integration
                    of the disciplines through such ventures has
                    generated more flexible and adaptive solution to
                    both the management and the science of common-pool
                    environmenta resources (12, 13). "

-   **History of economics and sustainability science - what generally
    characterizes the research questions that have been taken up?**

    -   Sustainability science has been succesful in addressing a number
        of economic issues. These include the interactions between the
        natural resource base and human income, such as Sub-saharan
        African exceptionalism in world poverty and the role of deprived
        natural resources, ethnic diversity, inequality and institutions
        in keeping many people caught in a "poverty trap" (Kates and
        Dasgupta 2007). Another area of economics that have been
        advanced by sustainability science is the operationalization of
        ecosystem services (or natural capital) valuation (G. C. Daily
        and Matson 2008), both through national statistical accounting
        schemes [K.-G. MÃ¤ler, Aniyar, and Jansson (2008)}, now mandated
        by the OECD under the termninology of green accounts, and,
        through on-the-ground ecosystem service based governance through
        actions spanning from the community level (Cowling et al. 2008)
        to the national level (Liu et al. 2008).

    -   The above two examples serve to illustrate that sustainability
        science' occupation with economics has mainly followed **two**
        pathways. (1) The role of disparity and central mode of human
        income and its interactions with the environmental system and
        the social effects it brings with though complex feedback loops.
        (2) Valuation of earths natural capital and operationalizing
        local and national governance schemes of these assets.

<br><br>

-   **History of economic and sustainability science - what generally
    characterizes some of the research questions that hasn't been taken
    up?**

    -   Other economics-related research questions have barely been
        addressed by sustainability science (\*at least when judging by
        the content published in the xxx number of articles under the
        sustainability science label in PNAS). Some of the most notable
        areas of omission appears to be the role of international licit
        and illicit financial capital flows and trade for sustainable
        development, and the role of financing and key-financial players
        in ensuring democractic or other political sustainablity
        transitions.

    -   Is this because sustainability science is naive to the role of
        money in decision making?
        -   We can not rule out this explanation, however sustainability
            science has dealt with issues of corruption in e.g.
            developing countries.
    -   Is this because these branches of research are less well
        developed in economics and finance?
        -   Doesn't seem likely since sustainability science has taken
            on other areas of research that have only recently emerged
            or been limited to small communities.

<br><br>

-   **Recent history of decreasing diveristy of economics and relations
    to other disciplines in terms of sustainability related questions**

    -   The fields of economics and finance research have changed over
        time. In particular, recent contributions document how the
        economical sciences during the 20th century underwent a
        continuing decrease in the diversity of research questions and
        methods being used (Colander 2005).

    -   *What about the recent history of finance research? Find some
        references to document this.*

    -   Recently, and partially fuelled by the financial crises of the
        21st century. There has been a concerted effort to re-energize
        the field of economics with a return to a more diverse set of
        approaches and questions. It remains to be shown, however, if
        the recent changing dynamics of economics research will also
        lead to an uptake of sustainability related questions.

    -   In recent decades many of the economical questions most
        pertinent for global sustainability have been addressed in
        communities that are only tangentially connected to the core fo
        economics research and in some cases arguably more closely
        connected to sustainability science. These include, the
        investigation of the material foundation and material limits to
        economic growth (club of rome ref, J. H. Brown et al. 2014; J.
        R. Burger et al. 2012; Burnside et al. 2012), the valuation of
        natural capital [Costanza and Daily refs], the global structure
        of the economy (Lenzen et al. 2012) , the impact of economic
        activies, such as trade, on the environment and vice versa
        [natural resources refs],**xxx**, **xxx**, **xxx**.

    -   In the meantime, sustainability science must actively seek to
        integrate with those communities that address questions of
        economics and finance most pertinent to global sustainability.

    -   \*Mention somewhere that the economical sciences have gone
        through a phase of decreasing diversity. A diversity that is now
        returning following the prolonged financial crises of the United
        States and Europe. Sustainability science can play an important
        role in maintaining this diversity by more fully integrating
        with some of the emerging branches of research.

AREAS THAT NEED ATTENTION
=========================

-   ***Finance in politics, financial players an dynamcis***
    -   **Role of finance in preventing democracy and implications
        sustainable transitions**

        \*A study from 2014 have documented how the role of campaign
        financing in US politics may lead to in-validation of long held
        theories of political science, such as the median voter theorem
        (Gilens and Page 2014). Similar ongoing studies are documenting
        how the probability of getting elected is correlated with the
        amount of campaing funds raised [**Cite Tom Ferguson
        research**]. The regulated earns more than the regulator and
        this financial inequality may present some moral challenges for
        sound decision-making in regulators (Ferguson and Johnson 2010).

        \*Such questions are of clear interested to sustainabliity
        science and research on global sustainablity. For example, what
        are the implications for the likelihood of sustainability
        transitions? If decision makers make choice in the interest of
        their financiers instead of in the interest of their electorate,
        may this either increase or decrease the likelihood and speed of
        sustainablity transitions wanted by the electorate?

    -   **Impact of major financial corporations on global
        sustainability (key players)**

        -   A recent study have documented that a small number of
            financial institutions play an important role in linking the
            global economy together (Vitali and Battiston 2013). What
            are the implications for global sustainability of such hyper
            connectivity?. Can the concepts of key-stone species, for
            example, be transferred to financial capital holders, and
            does this concept also apply to the socio-environmental
            effects of actions taking by the financial actors. Ongoing
            research are just starting to investigate such questions in
            the marine realm [*get Calle, JB and other SRC folks to fill
            in here*]. Similar research could be taken on in the
            agricultural and silvicultural realms with regard to
            land-use change etc.
    -   **Financial market dynamics and impact on global
        sustainability**

        -   The great recession of 2008 and the prolonged recession in
            Europe have been two of the most influential events on
            western hemisphere policy in the 21st century. Both
            recessions were partially caused by the influence of
            increasingly complex financial system on commodity prices
            such as housing prices and even national savings (Greece)
            [find articles on investment in the national savings of
            Greece, Italy and Spain **REFS**]. The impact of the
            following economic downturn on important environmental
            policies such as energy investments can be seen e.g. in many
            nations decision to explore options for liquified shale oil
            and natural gas and lowered ambitions in national and
            supra-national plans of transitioning to renewable energy
            sources [**REF**].

        -   The integration of financial market dynamics and complexity
            with sustainability science seems an important agenda to
            ensure a more resilient and holistic response to such
            events.

        -   Examples of remaining research questions with regard to the
            financial crisis are:
            -   What have some of socio-environmental impacts been of
                the fincial crisis on other continents?
                -   Can key trends in enviornmental and social
                    degradation or improvement be traced to events
                    relating to the financial crisis.
                -   How do other actors respond to financial crisis. Do
                    they e.g. learn to anticipate negative impacts from
                    prolonge recessions caused by financial market
                    complexity?

-   ***International financial transactions and flows***

    -   **Social and enviromental impact of financial transactions**
        -   With increasing complexity of financial markets, impacts of
            capital flows are in a manner similar to impacts of
            production and consumption in globalized supply chains
            becoming harder to track. Are international financial
            transactions playing important roles in determining social
            and environmental outcomes in regions where they flow from,
            through and end-up. Are these outcomes positive or negative
            for global sustainablity?
    -   **Social and enviornmental impact of illicit financial
        transaction**
        -   While captial flows of the financial market may prove an
            important factor influencing the likelihood of sustainable
            transitions, much of international trade happens outside the
            market. For example, the international market for wildlife
            medicine largely occur through illicit financial
            transactions. Such markets and transactions may in some
            cases have more immediately obvious impact on
            socio-environemntal sustainablity. For example, the negative
            impact of such trading on threatened species, sometimes
            appearing on the brnk of extinction, is well-documented
            through declines in e.g. elephants and rhinos in Africa.
            Tragically, from trophy hunting it has been shown that
            increasing rarity of hunted species may only increase the
            exclusiveness, price and demand for their derived products -
            potentially leading to a self-reinforcing feedback loop
            toward further decline (Lucille Palazy et al. 2011; L.
            Palazy et al. 2012). In other cases, the effect of illicit
            international capital flows are much less well documented.
            **give examples** Thus, whether licit or illicit, untangling
            the teleconnected socio-environmental effects of
            international capital flows should be of priority to
            sustainability science.

Notes on integration
--------------------

-   Emphasis on need to fully integrate economics and finance into
    sustainability science.

-   The current state of sustainability science or (environmental,
    social and economic sciences) is ripe with example of lack of
    integration.

    -   Examples of lack of integration between ecological, social and
        economic perspectives:

    -   Lack of integration of an explicitly ecological perspective into
        social sciences and socio-economic policy (J. H. Brown et al.
        2014, Burnside et al. (2012))
        -   With the implication of overlooking natural resource
            exploitation as an underlying trend for the "great
            recession" (J. H. Brown et al. 2014)

### INTRO

The concept of capital is important to sustainability science and
environmental conservation

-   The concept of capital, a term borrowed from economics, is
    foundational for sustainability science. Natural, social and
    financial capital distinguishes between the assets possess in
    currencies of environmental, societal and monetary value. This is
    one example of an important interplay between sustainability science
    and economics where sustainability science has adopted central
    concepts of economics. Sustainability science is addressing some
    research areas of economics

-   Sustainability science has begun to address the interplay between
    economic dynamics/sustainability and socio-environmental
    sustainability. Examples include, (1) the influence of economic
    inequality on environmental sustainability, (2) the measurement of
    economic growth integrating measures of financial capital with
    social and natural capital.

Sustainability science has been slower to pick up other central lines of
economic research \* However, many central areas of economics has yet to
make into integrated sustainability research. These include, (1) the
influence of money in politics and how they influence democratic
transitions toward sustainability, (2) how international monetary
transactions and illicit capital flows influence social and
environmental outcomes at their destinations and to what extent this
tele-couples econo-socio-environmental dynamics in areas fare apart.

### Title:

*Blind spots: Gaps and recent progress in linking real world economics
and sustainability science*

<br><br>

### Tenet:

Sustainability science has made good progress in showing the
environmental and social effects and limits to current resource use.
Yet, the field has had what can best be described as a "blind spot" to
the impacts of capital and so-called real world economics on the
environmental and social aspects of sustainability.

<br><br>

### Format suggestions:

A comment or perspective piece, e.g. for PNAS sustainability science
section, or some more realistic target journal. The piece would comment
on and highlight recent progress and future potential for stronger
integration of real world economics into sustainability science.

Four topics to highlight as gaps or areas of recent progress Remaining
gaps

-   The influence of capital in governance on environmental issues

-   International financial flows and consequences for democracy and the
    environment Areas of recent progress?

-   The environmental and social sustainability of income distributions
    (an area of progress?)

' Macroeconomic indicators (an area of progress?)

<br><br>

**The influence of finance in environmental decision making**

Main argument: Democracy as a cornerstone in a future Anthropocene that
is just, fair and sustainable.

Research questions: Do elected representatives represent the electorate
and the environment? What is the role of vested interest in
environmental policy?

Research needs: Studies looking at voting behaviour of elected
representatives on environmental issues in relation to campaign
financing and total amounts of raised capital and public opinion etc.

<br><br>

*Resources:*

Tom Ferguson analysis of votes and campaign finance in congress
elections (in prep)

Analysis of elected representatives' behavior on 1700 policy issues in
relation to vested interest and public opinion (Garry has reference that
cites Ferguson).

<br><br>

**Illicit financial flows - hidden connections to democracy and the
environment?**

Research questions: What is the role of financial flows in and out of
countries in affecting foundational aspects of a sustainable future?

1.  Do international investment/money laundering affect aspects of
    democracy and thus opportunities for sustainability?

2.  What are the direct and indirect impacts of international financial
    flows? Are they captured by analysis of commodity flows and supply
    chain/life cycle analysis?

**Sustainable income distributions (an area of recent progress?)**

*Research question:*

Which (post-transfer) income distributions are most sustainable in terms
of environment (and other aspects of human wellbeing)?

Recent progress:

Happiness and inequality studies?

GDP growth and inequality studies (does GDP growth increase inequality
while decreasing ecosystem and human well-being?)

What are unaddressed gaps here?

*Resources:*

What are other important resources Garry?

**The sustainability of macroeconomic indicators (an area of
progress?)**

Aim of section: Highlighting progress in reforming macroeconomic
indicators of growth to include ecoysytem services and human well-being.
Research question: I'm not sure what the area for sustainability science
is her

Basically I guess this section could be a description of the many known
undesirable environmental and societal effects of a pure GDP growth
based focus and an analysis of science' role in current progress in
changing the policy agenda.
