#### Importance of economic dynamics for the earth system and global sustainability

-   Human economic activitiy has a deciding role for the future of our
    planet. Yet some may argue that economics out of the three pillars
    of sustainability development - the social, the economic and the
    environmental - is the pillar least integrated in current approach
    to sustainability science.

-   The human economy is a driving factor of biodiversity loss and
    climate change. At the same time, global economic inequalities
    themselves can be viewed as one of the greatet barriers for
    addressing global environmental and socio-economic challenges.

-   At the same time Growth in human population and the economy are two
    trends that epitomizes the current environmental challenges of
    biodiversity loss and climate change and improvementes in living
    standards in many countries that have undergone economic growth in
    the 20th and 21st century. Associated with these trends is the
    dilemmas of global equity on a finite planet, including the question
    of whether countries with large economic prosperity need to consume
    less to allow the developing countries to achieve similar living
    standards.

-   In this context, understanding how the economy is linksed to the
    environment and to social aspects of society is of foundational
    importance for the science of global sustainability.

-   It is therefore concerning that scientific fields of the three
    pillars of sustainability are still only connected to a very limited
    extent. In particular, the field of economics and finance remains
    the pillar most poorly addressed by sustainability science
    [**REF**]. This is of great concern for the prospects of sustainable
    development guided by sound advice from the scientific community.

-   To address the need to integrate economics and finance better with
    sustainability science, in this Sustainability Science perspective
    we highlight two areas of importance:

    1.  recent advances in integrating economics into
        sustainability-oriented sciences.

    2.  major gaps for integrating economic into sustainability-oriented
        sciences.

#### A brief history of sustainability science - what concepts has been important for SS

-   Sustainability science emerged as a unified discipline in the
    beginning of the 21st century (Bettencourt and Kaur 2011). Before
    and after its unification, contributions to sustainability science
    has mainly come from three broad fields, the social sciences,
    engineering and the biological sciences (Bettencourt and Kaur 2011).

-   Contributions from these fields have mainly come from a small number
    of disciplinary clusters. For example, contributions from
    engineering has mainly come from systems and complex engineering and
    research. Contributions from the biological sciences have mainly
    come from the field of ecology with contributions to bidodiversity
    and ecosystem services. Similarly in the social sciences,
    contributions have not been evenly distributed across the field.

-   *Maybe describe more here some of the important concepts of
    sustainability science - but may be too redundant for the type of
    article.*

-   The contribution of the social sciences has remained fairly constant
    over time, but increased slightly since the unification in 2003
    (Bettencourt and Kaur 2011).

-   *Key papers* \* Future challenges, Charles Perrings PNAS 2007 \*
    "Although both economics and ecology are still full of examples of
    disciplinary myopia, the integration of the disciplines through such
    ventures has generated more flexible and adaptive solution to both
    the management and the science of common-pool environmenta resources
    (12, 13). " \* Evolution of sustainability science \* Beyond

#### History of economics and sustainability science - what generally characterizes the research questions that have been taken up?

-   Sustainability science has been succesful in addressing a number of
    economic issues. These include the interactions between the natural
    resource base and human income, such as Sub-saharan African
    exceptionalism in world poverty and the role of deprived natural
    resources, ethnic diversity, inequality and institutions in keeping
    many people caught in a "poverty trap" (Kates and Dasgupta 2007).
    Another area of economics that have been advanced by sustainability
    science is the operationalization of ecosystem services (or natural
    capital) valuation (Daily and Matson 2008), both through national
    statistical accounting schemes [Mäler, Aniyar, and Jansson (2008)},
    now mandated by the OECD under the termninology of green accounts,
    and, through on-the-ground ecosystem service based governance
    through actions spanning from the community level (Cowling et al.
    2008) to the national level (Liu et al. 2008).

-   The above two examples serve to illustrate that sustainability
    science' occupation with economics has mainly followed **two**
    pathways. (1) The role of disparity and central mode of human income
    and its interactions with the environmental system and the social
    effects it brings with though complex feedback loops. (2) Valuation
    of earths natural capital and operationalizing local and national
    governance schemes of these assets.

<br><br>

#### History of economic and sustainability science - what generally characterizes some of the research questions that hasn't been taken up?

-   Other economics-related research questions have barely been
    addressed by sustainability science (\*at least when judging by the
    content published in the xxx number of articles under the
    sustainability science label in PNAS). Some of the most notable
    areas of omission appears to be the role of international licit and
    illicit financial capital flows and trade for sustainable
    development, and the role of financing and key-financial players in
    ensuring democractic or other political sustainablity transitions.

-   Is this because sustainability science is naive to the role of money
    in decision making?
    -   We can not rule out this explanation, however sustainability
        science has dealt with issues of corruption in e.g. developing
        countries.
-   Is this because these branches of research are less well developed
    in economics and finance?
    -   Doesn't seem likely since sustainability science has taken on
        other areas of research that have only recently emerged or been
        limited to small communities.

<br><br>

#### Recent history of decreasing diveristy of economics and relations to other disciplines in terms of sustainability related questions

-   The fields of economics and finance research have changed over time.
    In particular, recent contributions document how the economical
    sciences during the 20th century underwent a continuing decrease in
    the diversity of research questions and methods being used (Colander
    2005).

-   *What about the recent history of finance research? Find some
    references to document this.*

-   Recently, and partially fuelled by the financial crises of the 21st
    century. There has been a concerted effort to re-energize the field
    of economics with a return to a more diverse set of approaches and
    questions. It remains to be shown, however, if the recent changing
    dynamics of economics research will also lead to an uptake of
    sustainability related questions.

-   In recent decades many of the economical questions most pertinent
    for global sustainability have been addressed in communities that
    are only tangentially connected to the core fo economics research
    and in some cases arguably more closely connected to sustainability
    science. These include, the investigation of the material foundation
    and material limits to economic growth (club of rome ref, Brown et
    al. 2014; Burger et al. 2012; Burnside et al. 2012), the valuation
    of natural capital [Costanza and Daily refs], the global structure
    of the economy (M. Lenzen et al. 2012), the impact of economic
    activies, such as trade, on the environment and vice versa [natural
    resources refs],**xxx**, **xxx**, **xxx**.

-   In the meantime, sustainability science must actively seek to
    integrate with those communities that address questions of economics
    and finance most pertinent to global sustainability.

-   \*Mention somewhere that the economical sciences have gone through a
    phase of decreasing diversity. A diversity that is now returning
    following the prolonged financial crises of the United States and
    Europe. Sustainability science can play an important role in
    maintaining this diversity by more fully integrating with some of
    the emerging branches of research.

Two advances in integrating the earth system in economic accounting
-------------------------------------------------------------------

<br><br>

### Greener economic accounting for natural capital

#### History of the ecosystem services and natural capital concept

-   The ecosystem services and natural capital concepts evolved out of
    other related concepts in the 1980's linked to the "land economy"
    and were mainstreamed in particular through the Millennium Ecosystem
    Assessment published in 2005 (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005).
    From a historical perspective (Gómez-Baggethun et al. 2010) "the
    trend towards monetization and commodification of ecosystem services
    is partly the result of a slow move from the original economic
    conception of nature's benefits as use values in Classical economics
    to their conceptualization in terms of exchange values in
    Neoclassical economics". This trend has led to debate over whether
    the use of the concept in its current form would stall aims of
    conservationists (Norgaard 2010; Norgaard 2008). The contrary
    argument sees the benefit of co-existence and exchange between a
    diversity of concepts and approaches, including both traditional
    biodiversity conservationist and newer ecosystem service or natural
    capital based apparoaches (Tallis et al. 2008; Reyers, Polasky,
    Tallis, and Mooney 2012; Reyers, Polasky, Tallis, Mooney, et al.
    2012). The main feature of the inclusivity argument is that the
    diversity of concepts are needed to interact with as many
    stakeholders as possible for the parrallel pursuit of conservation
    and enviornmentally sustainable economic development (Tallis and
    Lubchenco 2014).

Gomez-Baggethun (Gómez-Baggethun et al. 2010) in his review concludes
that the focus on monetary valuation and payment schemes related to the
ecosystem services and natural capital communities has indeed
contributed to attract political support for conservation. At the same
time "*a growing number of ecosystem services may have been commidified
and the Neoclassical economics paradigm and the market logic to tackle
environmental problems*" amplified.

-   Payments for ecosystem services [e.g. Kelsey Jack et al. 2008 PNAS]

#### Global economic dynamics in natural capital and ecosystem services

-   In 2014 (Costanza, Groot, et al. 2014) estimated the annual monetary
    loss of ecosystem services from land use change between 1997 and
    2011 to range between 4.3 to 20.2 trillion USD.

#### Recent impact of the ecosystem services and natural capital concept

-   A lot of progress has been made since the inception of ecosystem
    services valuation in the *XXXX*. Notable progress, includes the
    inception of the Intergovenrnmental Platform on Biodiversity and
    Ecosystem Services (Díaz et al. 2015). Political attention to global
    sustainability and the unsustainable dynamics of current
    measurements of economic growth has facilitated international
    research progress on integrated measures of growth, such as the
    Genuine Progress Indicator (Costanza, Kubiszewski, et al. 2014).
    Such integrated indicators of social, environmental and economic
    progress are now being suggested as indicators for the UN
    Sustainable Development Goals (Costanza, Kubiszewski, et al. 2014).
    In 2015 all OECD countries will adopt mandated green accounting
    systems (**REF**). The InVest tool developed to incorporate natural
    capital into decisions, is now *GIVE EXAMPLES OF NOTABLE USE*.

<br><br>

### Global trade and the telecoupling of socio-environmental dynamics

-   Leontief 1970 envisioned national accounting as a way of measuring
    the impact of economic activities and human consumption on the
    environment. With recent progress in accounting for resource use in
    globalized production and consumption chains using global
    multi-regional input-output models (MRIOs) to link together resource
    extraction, import, consumption and exports in national accounts
    (Manfred Lenzen et al. 2012, Lenzen et al. (2013), Lenzen et al.
    (2014)). Early phases of that vision is now being implemented in a
    number of ways. By associating the MRIO with enviromental and social
    variables (so-called satellite variables), environmentally and
    socially extended MRIOs are produced that allow to assess the
    environmental and social interlinked impacts of global ecnomomic
    activity (e.g. Wiedmann et al. 2013, M. Lenzen et al. (2012);
    Marques et al. 2012).

-   Early assesssments of long-standing economic hypotheses such as the
    Environmental Kuznets Curve and the paradigm of relative and
    absolute decoupling have been compromised by not acccounting for
    resources used in foreign contributes in the production of
    commodities consumed domestically. Still challenged a need to
    interpolate large amounts of missing data, the model provides a
    significant advancement in order for sustainability scientists to
    assess the degree to which relative and absolute decoupling is being
    reach in the globalized economy Wiedmann 2012, whether an
    Environmental Kuznets Curce really does exist, assess the domestic
    economic, environmental and health impact of pollution attributed to
    commodities that are being consumed in foreign countires (Marques et
    al. 2012), and similar how global trade drives biodiversity threats
    in the developing countries (M. Lenzen et al. 2012). One of the
    latest applications of this methodological advance will be a dataset
    on the value added to national economies by trade to be released by
    the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
    (<http://unctad.org/>). The dataset provides a new opportunity to
    assess and evaluate **...XXX**. These assessments have fundamental
    value for sustainability science as they answer basic questions
    about future paths for human development and the sustainability of
    current economic paradigms.

Implications of economic inequality globally, nationally and locally
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Economic inequality has steadily risen to the top of politicial agenda
fuelled by financial crises in North America and Euroope. Most recently
it was nominated by the World Economic Forum as one of the greatest
challenges of the century (World Economic Forum 2014). During the past
decade(s) inequality research has helped show how social and
environmental sustainability is tightly linked to this phenomenon from
the global level of earth system governance down to the level of the
mental well-being of the individual.

#### Consequences of global inequality dynamics

-   The world is heterogenous in terms of its natural resources,
    biophysical conditions as well as history of human colonization and
    colonial history. From those first principles global inequality in
    terms of economic wealth, is in and by itself not surprising.

-   The history of how global inequality has come to be is too rich a
    literature to cover in any detail here. However, the implications
    for global sustainability should be obvious to anyone who have
    followed global negotiations on any enviromental, social or economic
    topic.

-   The effort to combat climate change serves as an important lesson
    for all, including sustainability science, on how important
    historical inequalities are to take into account in any attempt of
    global stewardship.

-   Thus, historically unequal contributions to global climate change
    together with global economic inequality largely explains the
    deadlock in climate change negotiations and the global south's
    insistence on their rights to develop (Roberts 2001; Blaxekjær and
    Nielsen 2014), known in UN-jargon as "common, but differentiated
    responsibility".

-   A special issue on the African poverty trap in PNAS (Kates and
    Dasgupta 2007) highlighted the complex interplay between ethnic
    diversity, natural resource endowments and the global trade system
    in keeping some countries seeminly trapped in poverty (Collier
    2007). Such research highlights the potential need for special
    regulatory interventions in the global economy (Hyden 2007) to
    re-level the global economic playing field. In the end, such
    interventions, may be crucial to speed up progress in tackling
    global threats such as climate change.

        -   Can also add regional examples of grid-lock such as
            inequality within the European Union and challenges for the
            sustainability transition. With large inequality the poorer
            nations will have an incentive to stall transition policies
            for which they would at a disadvantage. EMU crises and
            inequality paper (Bitros, Batavia, and Nandakumar 2014).

        -   Progress in reaching MDGs is less in lower-income countries
            in particular countries with high burdens of HIV and
            Non-communicable diseases (Stuckler, Basu, and McKee 2010)

#### National dynamics and impacts of inequality

-   Just as global outcomes are highly influenced by global inequality,
    research is increasingly demonstrating how economic, social and
    environmental outcomes within nations are influenced by how wealth
    is distributed in society. For example, sustainability science
    research has focused on the need for more tightly regulating wealth
    in Africa to bring the country out of poverty (Kates and Dasgupta
    2007). **Median voter theorem** However, a study from 2014 (Gilens
    and Page 2014) raises the question about the influence of
    concentration of wealth on democracy and potential sustainability
    transitions also in Western democracies. Thus, Gilens (Gilens and
    Page 2014) showed that "economic elites and organized groups
    representing business interests have substantial independent impacts
    on US government policy while average citizens have little or no
    impact", the latter observation contrary to the prediction of the
    median voter theorem. *The degree to which these findings can be
    transferred to most developed nations or in some way can be
    explained by macroeconomic indicators such as the concentration of
    wealth will have important implications for sustainability science
    in particular with regard to the role of democracy in models of how
    to achieve transitions to for global sustainability*.

-   **Regulatory capture** In public administration, "regulatory
    capture" describes the situation where regulatory institutions act
    in favor of the entities they are supposed to regulate instead of
    the public interest they have been instituted to enact (Zinn 2002,
    Livermore and Revesz (2012)). Although the origins of capture-like
    regulatory behavior can be hard to identify (Shapiro 2012),
    regulated entities often have more financial resources available
    than the regulator and the job security of the regulator might in
    the end depend on the economic activity of the regulated. This
    economic inequality may present some moral challenges for sound
    regulatory decision-making (Ferguson and Johnson 2010). Cases where
    capture has been proposed to influence decision making on
    enviromental sustainability inlude the implementations of federal
    regulations such as the Endangered Species Act (Botello-Samson
    2010a) and Surface Mining Act (Botello-Samson 2010b) in the United
    States and off-shore drilling in Israel (Portman 2014) and the US
    (in Alaska and the Mexican Gulf Unger 2008; Shapiro 2012). Further
    the regulation of Genetically Modified Organisms in the United
    States (Hiatt and Park 2010; Hosmer 2013) is often contrasted with
    the public scepticism reflected in regulatory hesitance of GMO's and
    biotecnology in the EU (Ostrovsky 2007), which may partially be
    related to a great risk of capture in the US. A recent
    cross-national study found that "regulatory regimes have similar
    developmental patterns over time, although the time spent at each
    stage in the process can vary significantly according to unique
    domestic factor" (Newman and Howlett 2014). *Implications for
    sustainability / socio-ecological models?*

-   **Media control** The degree to which sustainability transitions
    have public support may depend on the degree to which the public is
    informed about the grand challenges of sustainability. An
    interesting question for sustainability science in the context of
    national inequality can look into the influence of the economic
    concentration of multimedia ownership structures and the degree to
    which communities locally and nationally are aware about specific
    and general sustainability grand challenges. (**PERFORM LITERATURE
    SEARCH**) The results of this line of research will in turn
    influence the models that sustainability science will propose for
    viable sustainable transitions.

-   Media coverage influences public behavior and vice versa. If media
    coverage is influenced by the owner of a given media, high
    concentration of media ownership can lead to over or underreporting
    of a given issue, lack of diversity or disinformation (also from
    vested interest). For example, newspaper coverage of climate change
    in Japan from 1998 and 2007 correlated with increased public
    awareness (Sampei and Aoyagi-Usui 2009) (Global Environmental Change
    study). *Mass media have been critical to highlight enviornmental
    concerns in the past* (Boykoff 2009).

-   \*\*Two general issues seems to dominate in the research literature:
    (1) How organizations brand themselves through media. (2) Influence
    on public awareness and concern of media coverage.

-   **Quality of reporting**

    -   (Boykoff, Frame, and Randalls 2010) found a need to increase the
        diversity of media framings related to how to tackle climate
        change beyond "climate stabilization", but did not relate this
        lack of diversity back to ownership structure or concentration.

    -   (Boykoff and Boykoff 2007) \*On the role of journalistic norms
        in decreasing information content about antrhopogenic climate
        change in US mass media. "consistent adherence to interacting
        journalistic norms has contributed to impediments in the
        coverage of anthropogenic climate change science. Through
        analysis of US newspaper and television coverage of human
        contributions to climate change from 1988 through 2004, this
        paper finds that adherence to first-order journalistic norms -
        personalization, dramatization, and novelty - significantly
        influence the employment of second-order norms - authority-order
        and balance - and that this has led to informationally deficient
        mass-media coverage of this crucial issue. By critically
        scrutinizing US print and television media as a 'public arena,'
        we improve understanding of how journalistic activities have
        shaped interactions at the interface with climate science,
        policy and the public." **Question - are these journalistic
        norms tied to ownership structure?**

    -   *Climate contrarians* (Boykoff and Olson 2013) in Celebrity
        Studies: illustrate the growth pathways of climate change
        contrarians in US media (i.e. decrease in quality) one of which
        is hypothesized to be relation to the carbon-based industry:
        "threefold analysis: of the motivations that prop up these
        contrarian stances, such as ideological or evidentiary
        disagreement to the orthodox views of science (also known as
        scientific consensus); **the drive to fulfil the perceived
        desires of special interests (for example, carbon-based

        martyrdom and the more general desire for notoriety. In these
        ways, celebrity is a vehicle for influence, and influence is
        vital to decision-making within the dynamic architectures of
        contemporary climate science, politics and policy"

    -   *Balanced reporting on consensus issues* (Boykoff and Boykoff
        2004) GEC "the prestige press's adherence to balance actually
        leads to biased coverage of both anthropogenic contributions to
        global warming and resultant action".

    -   *Political economy* (Boykoff and Yulsman 2013) Wired "This paper
        addresses contemporary political economics-from greater
        workloads and reductions in specialist science journalism to
        digital innovations and new media organizational forms-as they
        relate to media coverage of climate change." *decline in climate
        change reportint* (Boykoff and Yulsman 2013) Wired "In the face
        of many ongoing climate science and climate-related weather
        events to report on, we must look for explanations for this
        decline in the realm of political economy." On covering global
        environmental issues - (Boykoff 2009) "Meanwhile, political
        economic forces have contributed to tremendous pres- sures on
        and within the news industry, where these issues have become
        more, not less, chal- lenging to cover."

    -   *Some short-term improvements combined with persistent long-term
        challenges* (Boykoff 2009) "there is empirical evidence to
        suggest that there have been short-term improvements in media
        representations of environmental issues, such as more accurate
        coverage of anthropogenic climate change. However, over the
        long-term scale, many institutional challenges persist for
        enhanced media reporting on the environment."

-   **Concentration**

    -   Germano shows through mathematical modelling that ownership
        concentration influences the tendency of media to underreport or
        censor issues that may influence there advertisers negatively.
        "Given that over half the revenues of global newspaper
        publishing come from advertising (80% in the US and 57% in OECD
        countries, OECD, 2010), we study how media firms internalize the
        effect of their own coverage on advertisers' sales and hence on
        their own advertising revenues. We show, within a framework of
        non-localized, Hotelling-type competition among arbitrary
        numbers of media firms and outlets, that (i) \***topics
        sensitive to advertisers can be underreported by all outlets in
        the market, (ii) underreporting tends to increase with the
        concentration of ownership, and (iii) adding outlets, while
        keeping the number of owners fixed, can further increase the
        bias**. We argue that self-censorship can potentially cover a
        wide range of topics and generate empirically large
        externalities" (Germano and Meier 2013)

    -   While media over the long-term have undergone a process of
        ownership "unconcentration", media is currently undergoing a
        recent trend of increasing concentration (Vizcarrondo 2013).

    -   (George 2007) A study of US newspaper coverage and reporter
        assignment in 1993, 1994 and 2004 found that the repositioning
        of products during mergers and resulting concentration of
        ownership led to increasing variety and differentiaion in
        coverage. The study did not address the variety and
        diversification in relation to topics of sustainability or
        topics of interest to the ownership. The onwer's need to
        differnetiate its increasing number of products may therefore be
        the largest counter acting force to decrease in diversity or
        bias in reporting during increasing concentration of media
        ownership.

    -   *Increasing concentration of ownership in Pakistan despite
        political and regulatory intentions of the opposite* (Rasul and
        Proffitt 2013). There is also a study on concentration from
        Latvia after becoming member of the EU which does not cite the
        results. Also increasing concentration in Taiwan (Chen 2002)

    -   (Nash and Bacon 2006) in a review of pacific media coverage on
        environmental sustainability in relation to ownership structure
        fould little effect. Instead environment reporting had a
        "motherhood" status, which also however ruled out making any
        assumptions about the quality of reporting.

    -   Swedish case studies: "corporate voices make substantial use of
        environmental and ecological arguments in their strategic
        communication, but they provide little useful information about
        the company's impact and do not usually foster forms of dialogic
        stakeholder engagement" (Lischinsky and Sjölander 2014).
        (Tjernström 2007) investigated a case study of political
        intention to decrease ownership of TV media with the opposite
        outcome for Swedish TV4

    -   Fortune 100 companies need to manage the information sources
        that there employees use to get information about their
        sustainability. Note: Negative implications of employer control
        of employee knowledge, framed as a management issue. (Craig and
        Allen 2013)

    -   *Digitalization as a driver of concentration?* (Compaine 2010)
        "One of Noam's final and most useful insights, coming in Chapter
        19, "The Findings and the Model," is that any trend to
        concentration is largely the result of declining prices for
        media consumers. This is primarily the outcome of the digital
        revolution. For example, the music industry has found it hard to
        maintain prices and the online newspaper business is still
        struggling with a model for user payment. Telephone calls can be
        made for close to nothing using Voice over IP services. Yet the
        high fixed cost and low marginal costs of most information
        products has been a strong incentive for players to meet the
        price deflation challenge first by reducing costs, by attempts
        at product differentiation, but eventually by seeking merger or
        acquisition by a competitor to be able to maintain some control
        over prices."

    -   *Number of media vs. number of source media* (Winseck 2008) The
        State of Media Ownership and Media Markets: Competition or
        Concentration and Why Should We Care? "This article presents a
        global overview of the state of communications media ownership
        and markets. The primary issue at stake is whether or not
        markets and ownership are becoming more or less concentrated.
        After reviewing contrasting views on this issue, I suggest that
        the question turns on whether or not we consider 'numerical
        diversity' (the number of channels available in any given area)
        versus 'source diversity' (a measure of the number of media
        owners in any given area). Drawing on recent data I suggest that
        while there is undoubtably greater 'numerical diversity', we are
        seeing - within countries, regionally and globally - greater
        concentration at the level of 'source diversity'. While new
        media, especially the Internet, open up unprecedented
        opportunities for people to access and distribute information,
        the emergence of a powerful nexus between both 'old' and 'new'
        media means that the character of media ownership and markets
        still matters greatly. This nexus of ownership and market power
        spans different segments of the media and is qualitatively
        different from previous times. These factors have an important
        influence on the evolution of media technologies and markets,
        the work of media professionals and the character of information
        and media content"

-   **General importance for sustainability science** Such questions are
    of clear interested to sustainabliity science and research on global
    sustainablity. For example, what are the implications for the
    likelihood of sustainability transitions? If decision makers make
    choice in the interest of their financiers instead of in the
    interest of their electorate, may this either increase or decrease
    the likelihood and speed of sustainablity transitions wanted by the
    electorate? Relevant cross-country questions for sustainability
    science ask whether vested interests have a larger influence on the
    trajectory of publicly supported pathways for sustainability
    transitions in more unequal nations or whether these phenomena are
    rare unique cases or nearly universal. These recent research
    advances offer important specific questions for sustainability
    science to integrate with and more generally identifies economics
    research on the concentration wealth and the research on political
    economy as priorities for integration. *The worst case scenario for
    sustainability science is if inferred conclusions and proposed
    models are naive to the importance of these areas of economics in
    law, public administration, political science and communication.*

-   **Implications for society, well-being, health and environment** The
    final line of research highlighted here relating to national
    inequality relates to the social and environmental impacts of
    differences in equality. Highlight here recent findings on whether
    more equal societies have better public health, are more happy, and
    better environmental protection. This relates back to the mechanisms
    of concentration of wealth, one person one vote, regulatory capture
    and media ownership structures.

        implications for health inequality* If states do not find ways
        to increase their capacities then PTAs are likely to become much

        2015).

        inverse association with income increased.

    -   (Bhandari, Newton, and Bernabé 2015) Lower ratio of dentist per
        population in more unequal countries could be a sign of
        divestment in health car in unequal countries. "This study shows
        an inverse relationship between income inequalityand use of
        dental services. Of the two indicators of disinvestment in
        health careassessed, only dentist-to-population ratio was
        associated with income inequalityand use of dental services."

        most affected in terms of incidence and poor outcomes of stroke.

        marginalised communities have a higher risk of dying from
        non-communicable diseases (NCDs) than do more advantaged groups
        and communities.". "Effective actions to reduce NCD inequalities
        include equitable early childhood development programmes and
        education; removal of barriers to secure employment in
        disadvantaged groups; comprehensive strategies for tobacco and
        alcohol control and for dietary salt reduction that target low
        socioeconomic status groups; universal, financially and

        attention to the health risks associated with the social
        structure and ecology of neighbourhoods, innovative approaches
        to community level interventions may ensue.

    -   The Haves, the Have-Nots, and the Health of Everyone: The
        Relationship Between Social Inequality and Environmental Quality
        Annual Review of Public Health, 2014 [@]
        -   SUMMARY POINTS
        -   1.  Evidence supporting the equality/sustainability
                hypothesis suggests that social inequality is bad for
                the environment, which may in turn explain why societies
                with more inequality appear to be less healthy.
        -   1.  Social inequality may degrade the environment through
                asymmetries in political power that affect who
                experiences the benefits and harms of pollution.
        -   1.  Social inequality may also worsen environmental quality
                by increasing the environmental intensity of a society's
                consumption or decreasing social cohesion and the
                willingness to cooperate to protect common resources.
        -   1.  Evidence of a negative association between social
                inequality and environmental quality appears strongest
                for localized air pollutants and markers of access to
                safe water and sanitation, and weaker for more dispersed
                pollutants, such as CO2, and other measures of water
                quality.
        -   1.  The evidence linking inequality with worse environmental
                quality is more consistent in within-country studies
                from the United States than in between-country studies,
                perhaps because the former benefit from a greater
                consistency in data and the fact that the larger
                political and development contexts are held fixed.
        -   1.  Challenges to conducting this research include the fact
                that inequality changes slowly over time so that
                longitudinal effects are hard to estimate and the fact
                that nonlinear effects and effect modifiers appear to
                play a part.
        -   1.  Although the evidence remains somewhat mixed and more
                research is needed, there are intriguing indications
                that reducing social inequality may not only help those
                who are most exposed to health-damaging pollutants but
                may also improve environmental conditions for all.

-   *Research agenda:*
    -   Media ownership structures - is disinformation and public
        awareness about sustainability issues smaller in nations with
        higher concentration of wealth in media (or is it ownership
        structure?)
        -   Australia - media owned by coal ownership
        -   Employment in PR industry versus journalism
        -   Role of large media corportations in demochratic sustainable
            transitions
        -   Communication of information about non-empowering
            information/news
    -   Societal health and happinness - government investments smaller
        public health investments?
    -   Research question - to what degree are sustainability dynamics
        in nations with high concentration of wealth different nations
        with less concentration of wealth?

    -   "Rising wealth concentration contributed to the crisis because
        the increasing asset demand from the rich played a key role in
        the rise of the structured credit market and enabled poor and
        middle-income households to accumulate increasing amounts of
        debt. To tame the inherent instability of the current mode of
        capitalism it is necessary to reduce inequality." - Sabalini

-   **Internal conflict - poverty and income inequality**
    -   Poverty, i.e. global inequality is a better predictor of
        internal conflict and insurgency than domestic inequality.
        (Fearon and Laitin 2003) "after controlling for per capita
        income, more ethnically or religiously diverse countries have
        been no more likely to experience significant civil violence in
        this period. We argue for understanding civil war in this period
        in terms of insurgency or rural guerrilla warfare, a particular
        form of military practice that can be harnessed to diverse
        political agendas. The factors that explain which countries have
        been at risk for civil war are not their ethnic or religious
        characteristics but rather the conditions that favor insurgency.
        These include poverty-which marks financially and
        bureaucratically weak states and also favors rebel
        recruitment-political instability, rough terrain, and large
        populations."

#### Local dynamics and impacts of inequality

-   Local hotspots of economic inequality is correlated with loss of
    biodiversity (Mikkelson, Gonzalez, and Peterson 2007; Holland,
    Peterson, and Gonzalez 2009) and poverty hotspots exhibit poorer
    environmental quality and hence opportunities for improving public
    health (Cushing et al. 2015)

-   Economic inequality leads to mental stresses and loss of social
    capital whihc results in largely unsustainable economic growth based
    on short-sighted compensatory consumer behavior (Bartolini 2014).

-   Income inequality and health - (Pickett and Wilkinson 2015)

    -   There is a very large literature examining income inequality in
        relation to health. Early reviews came to different
        interpretations of the evidence, though a large majority of
        studies reported that health tended to be worse in more unequal
        societies. More recent studies, not included in those reviews,
        provide substantial new evidence.
    -   Key points
    -   Evidence that income inequality is associated with worse health
        is reviewed.
    -   It meets established epidemiological and other scientific
        criteria for causality.
    -   The causal processes may extend to violence and other problems
        with social gradients.
    -   Reducing income inequality will improve population health and
        wellbeing.

### Finance in politics and key financial players

<br><br>

#### Role of finance in preventing democracy and implications sustainable transitions - is only the case in more unequal nations?

\*A study from 2014 have documented how the role of campaign financing
in US politics may lead to in-validation of long held theories of
political science, such as the median voter theorem (Gilens and Page
2014). Similar ongoing studies are documenting how the probability of
getting elected is correlated with the amount of campaing funds raised
[**Cite Tom Ferguson research**]. The regulated earns more than the
regulator and this financial inequality may present some moral
challenges for sound decision-making in regulators (Ferguson and Johnson
2010).

\*Such questions are of clear interested to sustainabliity science and
research on global sustainablity. For example, what are the implications
for the likelihood of sustainability transitions? If decision makers
make choice in the interest of their financiers instead of in the
interest of their electorate, may this either increase or decrease the
likelihood and speed of sustainablity transitions wanted by the

#### Impact of ownership structures and financial corporations on global sustainability (key players)

-   A recent study have documented that a small number of financial
    institutions play an important role in linking the global economy
    together (Vitali and Battiston 2013). What are the implications for
    global sustainability of such hyper connectivity?. Can the concepts
    of key-stone species, for example, be transferred to financial
    capital holders, and does this concept also apply to the
    socio-environmental effects of actions taking by the financial
    actors. Ongoing research are just starting to investigate such
    questions in the marine realm [*get Calle, JB and other SRC folks to
    fill in here*]. Similar research could be taken on in the
    agricultural and silvicultural realms with regard to land-use change
    etc.

-   **Fertilizer prices** is one case where prices may be controlled by
    a cartel-like ownership structure and could be a terrestrial model
    for the key-financial actors model (**Christopher Gilbert GEDB
    seminar 150424**). **(Ott 2012)** "Torero (2011) examines the market
    structure and shows that the fertilizer industry is a global one
    with a high level of concentration." \*\*(Hernandez and Torero
    2011): "The results of the study indicate that the fertilizer
    industry is a global market with high levels of concentration and
    increasing trade. The top five countries control more than 50
    percent of the world's production capacity for all major fertilizer
    products. There is also a high level of concentration at the country
    level among the major producing countries, except for China. The
    high and increasing levels of trade in the industry are evident from
    the higher dependence of several regions on imported fertilizer."
    "*It appears that despite the high levels of concentration in the
    industry, prices are even higher in further concentrated markets due
    to the apparent greater market power enjoyed by a couple of firms*."

### The global impact of investments and market dynamics

-   The great recession of 2008 and the prolonged recession in Europe
    have been two of the most influential events on western hemisphere
    policy in the 21st century. Both recessions were partially caused by
    the influence of increasingly complex financial system on commodity
    prices such as housing prices and even national savings (Greece)
    [find articles on investment in the national savings of Greece,
    Italy and Spain **REFS**]. The impact of the following economic
    downturn on important environmental policies such as energy
    investments can be seen e.g. in many nations decision to explore
    options for liquified shale oil and natural gas and lowered
    ambitions in national and supra-national plans of transitioning to
    renewable energy sources [**REF**].

-   Increasing investment in food commodities from index investors in
    2007 may have exacerbaed the spikes in food prices in 2008 and 2011
    and consequently had a role in the social unrest that these price
    rises helped unleash (**Christopher Gilbert GEDB seminar 150424 -
    Index investor activity increased before price spikes**).

-   The integration of financial market dynamics and complexity with
    sustainability science seems an important agenda to ensure a more
    resilient and holistic response to such events.

-   Examples of remaining research questions with regard to the
    financial crisis are:

    -   What have socio-environmental impacts been of the fincial crisis
        on other continents?

    -   Can key trends in environmental and social degradation or
        improvement be traced to events relating to the financial
        crisis.

    -   How do other actors respond to financial crisis. Do they e.g.
        learn to anticipate negative impacts from prolonge recessions
        caused by financial market complexity?

### International financial transactions and flows

<br><br>

#### Social and enviromental impact of financial transactions

-   With increasing complexity of financial markets, impacts of capital
    flows are in a manner similar to impacts of production and
    consumption in globalized supply chains becoming harder to track.
    Are international financial transactions playing important roles in
    determining social and environmental outcomes in regions where they
    flow from, through and end-up. Are these outcomes positive or
    negative for global sustainablity?

<br><br>

#### Social and enviornmental impact of illicit financial transactions

-   While captial flows of the financial market may prove an important
    factor influencing the likelihood of sustainable transitions, much
    of international trade happens outside the market. For example, the
    international market for wildlife medicine largely occur through
    illicit financial transactions. Such markets and transactions may in
    some cases have more immediately obvious impact on
    socio-environemntal sustainablity. For example, the negative impact
    of such trading on threatened species, sometimes appearing on the
    brnk of extinction, is well-documented through declines in e.g.
    elephants and rhinos in Africa. Tragically, from trophy hunting it
    has been shown that increasing rarity of hunted species may only
    increase the exclusiveness, price and demand for their derived
    products - potentially leading to a self-reinforcing feedback loop
    toward further decline (Palazy et al. 2011; Palazy et al. 2012). In
    other cases, the effect of illicit international capital flows are
    much less well documented. **give examples** Thus, whether licit or
    illicit, untangling the teleconnected socio-environmental effects of
    international capital flows should be of priority to sustainability
    science.

### Financial innovation for sustainabiltiy

<br><br>

#### Innovation of investments for sustainability

-   Non-governmental financial investments are playing an increasing
    role in addressing concerns related to social and environmental
    sustainaiblity, in the developing as well as the developed world
    [**REF**]. Philanthropy has played a role in ensuring environmental,
    social and economic sustainability for centuries. Associated with
    the increase in the role of private investments has been an
    increasing diversification of types of investments for
    sustainability [**REF**]. From the well-known micro-financing
    strategies [**REF**] to green bond markets and other types of
    investment for impact [**REF**].

-   Sustainability science needs to embrace these recent developments by
    asking a number of research and solution-oriented questions: (1) How
    effective are private financial investments in ensuring positive
    sustainability-related outcomes, compared to, for example,
    governnmental investments?; (2) Which types of private financial
    investments are most effective in various geographical areas and in
    solving different sustainability-challenges.

#### Notes on integration

-   Emphasis on need to fully integrate economics and finance into
    sustainability science.

-   The current state of sustainability science or (environmental,
    social and economic sciences) is ripe with example of lack of
    integration.

    -   Examples of lack of integration between ecological, social and
        economic perspectives:

    -   Lack of integration of an explicitly ecological perspective into
        social sciences and socio-economic policy (Brown et al. 2014,
        Burnside et al. (2012))

        -   With the implication of overlooking natural resource
            exploitation as an underlying trend for the "great
            recession" (Brown et al. 2014)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Older snippets

#### INTRO

The concept of capital is important to sustainability science and
environmental conservation

-   The concept of capital, a term borrowed from economics, is
    foundational for sustainability science. Natural, social and
    financial capital distinguishes between the assets possess in
    currencies of environmental, societal and monetary value. This is
    one example of an important interplay between sustainability science
    and economics where sustainability science has adopted central
    concepts of economics. Sustainability science is addressing some
    research areas of economics

-   Sustainability science has begun to address the interplay between
    economic dynamics/sustainability and socio-environmental
    sustainability. Examples include, (1) the influence of economic
    inequality on environmental sustainability, (2) the measurement of
    economic growth integrating measures of financial capital with
    social and natural capital.

Sustainability science has been slower to pick up other central lines of
economic research \* However, many central areas of economics has yet to
make into integrated sustainability research. These include, (1) the
influence of money in politics and how they influence democratic
transitions toward sustainability, (2) how international monetary
transactions and illicit capital flows influence social and
environmental outcomes at their destinations and to what extent this
tele-couples econo-socio-environmental dynamics in areas fare apart.

#### Main body

-   Green accounting (progress, next steps)

-   Inequality and environmental, social and financial sustainability

-   The role of money in facilitating or slowing down democratic
    transformations toward sustainability

Perspective \* From green accounting to national accounts revisions

<br><br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Even older snippets

<br><br>

#### Title:

*Blind spots: Gaps and recent progress in linking real world economics
and sustainability science*

<br><br>

#### Tenet:

Sustainability science has made good progress in showing the
environmental and social effects and limits to current resource use.
Yet, the field has had what can best be described as a "blind spot" to
the impacts of capital and so-called real world economics on the
environmental and social aspects of sustainability.

<br><br>

#### Format suggestions:

A comment or perspective piece, e.g. for PNAS sustainability science
section, or some more realistic target journal. The piece would comment
on and highlight recent progress and future potential for stronger
integration of real world economics into sustainability science.

Four topics to highlight as gaps or areas of recent progress Remaining
gaps

-   The influence of capital in governance on environmental issues

-   International financial flows and consequences for democracy and the
    environment Areas of recent progress?

-   The environmental and social sustainability of income distributions
    (an area of progress?)

-   Macroeconomic indicators (an area of progress?)

<br><br>

**The influence of finance in environmental decision making**

Main argument: Democracy as a cornerstone in a future Anthropocene that
is just, fair and sustainable.

Research questions: Do elected representatives represent the electorate
and the environment? What is the role of vested interest in
environmental policy?

Research needs: Studies looking at voting behaviour of elected
representatives on environmental issues in relation to campaign
financing and total amounts of raised capital and public opinion etc.

<br><br>

**Illicit financial flows - hidden connections to democracy and the
environment?**

Research questions: What is the role of financial flows in and out of
countries in affecting foundational aspects of a sustainable future?

1.  Do international investment/money laundering affect aspects of
    democracy and thus opportunities for sustainability?

2.  What are the direct and indirect impacts of international financial
    flows? Are they captured by analysis of commodity flows and supply
    chain/life cycle analysis?

**Sustainable income distributions (an area of recent progress?)**

*Research question:*

Which (post-transfer) income distributions are most sustainable in terms
of environment (and other aspects of human wellbeing)?

Recent progress:

Happiness and inequality studies?

GDP growth and inequality studies (does GDP growth increase inequality
while decreasing ecosystem and human well-being?)

What are unaddressed gaps here?

<br><br>

*Resources:*

What are other important resources Garry?

<br><br>

**The sustainability of macroeconomic indicators (an area of
progress?)**

Aim of section: Highlighting progress in reforming macroeconomic
indicators of growth to include ecoysytem services and human well-being.
Research question: I'm not sure what the area for sustainability science
is her

Basically I guess this section could be a description of the many known
undesirable environmental and societal effects of a pure GDP growth
based focus and an analysis of science' role in current progress in
changing the policy agenda.
