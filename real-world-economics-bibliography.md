    -   Title: **Community-based conservation in a globalized world**

    -   **Economic perspective**

    -   Integrating conservation and (social and economic) development.

        -   I.e. preserving the natural basis while developing.
    -   Quote: "*community-based conservation as a panacea, like
        government-based conservation as a panacea, ignores the
        necessity of **managing commons at multiple levels, with
        vertical and horizontal interplay among institutions***"

    -   Quote: "*Improving the **integration of conservation and
        development requires** rethinking conservation by using a
        complexity perspective and the ability to deal with multiple
        objectives, use of partnerships and deliberative processes, and
        learning from commons research to develop diagnostic tools.*"

    -   Quote: "*The shift of attention to processes at multiple levels
        fundamentally alters the way in which the governance of
        conservation development may be conceived and developed, using
        diagnostics within a pluralistic framework rather than a
        blueprint approach.*"

    -   Title: **Knowledge systems for sustainable development**

    -   **how to create institutions that effectively harness S&T for
        sustainability**

    -   **Economic perspective**

        -   Applies an institutional perspective to the mediation of
            science & technology for sustainable development.
    -   Quote: "*Many believe that science and technology (S&T) must
        play a more central role in sustainable development, yet little
        systematic scholarship exists on how to create institutions that
        effectively harness S&T for sustainability.*"

    -   Quote: "*This study suggests that efforts to mobilize S&T for
        sustainability are more likely to be effective when they manage
        boundaries between knowledge and action in ways that
        simultaneously enhance the salience, credibility, and legitimacy
        of the information they produce.*"

    -   Quote: "*Effective systems apply a variety of institutional
        mechanisms that facilitate communication, translation and
        mediation across boundaries.*"

        -   Decline in proportion of worlf population under absolute
            poverty from 1981 to 2004.

        -   Total number of poor is stable or increasing (notably in
            sub-Saharan Africa).

        -   Finds urbanization of poverty - increasingly poor people are
            living in the city with incomes defined as poverty.

        -   **Resource curse**

        -   Quote: *"Africa's current eco-nomic opportunity is its
            natural resource rents. A disproportionate share of Africa's
            population lives in resource-rich countries, and for the
            foreseeable future commodity prices are going to be high
            with discoveries skewed toward the region."*

        -   Quote: *"It seems that the typical resource-rich
            countrymight grow faster under autocracy. However, as set
            out in Human Geography, Africa's high ethnic diversity makes
            autocracy damaging: Africa's resource-rich countries may not
            have the option of growth through autocracy."*

        -   Quote: *"The formof polity that appears to be best suited to
            ethnically diverse societies with resource rents is a
            democracy with unusually strong checks and balances and
            decen- tralized public spending.Howthe government can use
            power needs to be constrained, rather than simply how it
            attains power. **Botswana** demonstrates both that this
            combination is possible inAfrica and that it is effective in
            delivering development in resource-rich societies."*

        -   Quote: *"Resource-rich societies face a further difficulty
            during export booms. Globally, during these booms the pace
            of policy reform slows (18). Hence, societies that have
            painfully realized that rapid reformis necessary, such as
            has been the case in **Nigeria** since 2003, may find that
            boom conditions remove the sense of urgency from the reform
            agenda and divert political attention to the contest for
            spending. Thus, the very conditions in which good policies
            have their highest pay-off tend to undermine the political
            process of achieving them."*

    -   **Economic perspective**

        -   Macroeconomic perspective on monetary poverty in Africa.

        -   The article concludes that the main approach to decreasing
            poverty should be to grow the economy (in terms of GDP).
            -   This reveals part of the dichotomies still apparent in
                sustainability science between researchers grounded in
                deveopment economics and geography on one hand and the
                core of sustainablity science, ecosystem services and
                ecology on the other.
        -   Underlying cause: Africa's economies have not been growing
            (in terms of GDP).
            -   A role of sustainability sciencr has been to open up the
                discussion on new measures of (economic) growth.
            -   They seem not to be integrated in this article from
                2007, thus there is still need for further activity,
                here.
        -   Internatinoal interventions beyond aid to bring Africa out
            of poverty
            1.  International society must set out templates for
                transparent economies (including industry and banking).
            2.  International action to give resource-scarce African
                countries preferential market access.
            3.  Expand international peacekeeping to prevent internal
                conflict.
        -   Overarching resource problem for Africa
            -   Quote *The fourth, and perhaps least tractable problem,
                is that so much of Africa's population lives in
                landlocked, resource-scarce states. I have discussed
                how, because these states have multiple forms of
                dependency on neighbors, Africa needs a strong regional
                political architecture that can internalize these
                externalities.*
            -   Quote *Long-term aid, while targeted toward low-income
                countries, is currently intended to raise income. The
                international community has not yet faced the prospect
                that even with our best efforts these societies are
                likely to remain low income for a long time.*

    -   **An operational model for mainstreaming ecosystem services for
        implementation**

    -   Conclusion: "At the core of our operational model are three
        elements: socially relevant, user-inspired research, stakeholder
        empowerment, and adaptive management embedded in learning
        organizations. The goal is the achievement of social and
        ecological resilience in an uncertain world."

    -   **Referencing use**

        -   Can be cited to support claim that parts of sustainability
            science, namely ecosystem service research, has been
            socially naive.
        -   Can be cited to support claim that ecosystem service
            research has mainly focused on valuation.
        -   Sustainability science' role as integrator disciplines,
            including in principle, finance
            -   *"The activities prescribed by the model will not be
                easy to implement. Socially engaged, multi- and
                interdisciplinary re- search is relatively rare. Our
                process requires a fundamental change, or
                transformation, in the way research generates knowl-
                edge (3, 4). Researchers will need to be responsive to
                stake- holder needs, collaborate with many groups with
                values and norms foreign to their own, operate as
                facilitators of knowledge transfer to stakeholders, and
                be prepared to engage time- consuming processes that are
                not sympathetic to career aspira- tions and performance
                benchmarks predicated by the accumu- lation of
                publications in high-impact journals (7, 90). Moreover,
                the education philosophies of almost all universities
                are not conducive to multi- and interdisciplinary
                research; instead, they encourage the atomization of
                disciplines and entrench the boundaries between them (4,
                58, 91). However, the recent emergence of sustainability
                science (11) is a very positive development. The
                operational model presented here provides many
                opportunities for conducting research on the complex
                problems inherent in managing social-ecological systems.
                Rec- ognition of the importance of this research through
                enhanced funding and status can provide the impetus for
                its growth."*
    -   **Economic perspective**

        -   Most ecosystem service research has focused on valuation and
            is not embedded in a social process.

        -   Criticizes focus on monetary valuation. I.e. there are many
            services where a common monetary currency may not make
            sense.

        -   Criticizes modus operandi of economic donor organizations in
            developing countries, which are focused on short term
            outcomes.

        -   Talks about consumerist economic paradigm and high
            discounting rates of future events.

        ecosystem services through to the **design, implementation, and
        assessment of finance and policy mechanisms and systems of

    -   Quote: "*Around the world, leaders are increasingly recognizing
        ecosystems as natural capital assets that supply life-support
        services of tremendous value.*"

    -   Quote: "*The challenge is to turn this recognition into
        incentives and institutions that will guide wise investments in
        natural capital, on a large scale.*"

    -   Quote - para 1: "***Even in the face of intensifying pressures
        and risks on the global environmental front, there is a growing
        feeling of Renaissance in the conservation community. This flows
        from the promise in reaching, together with a much more diverse
        and powerful set of leaders than in the past, for new approaches
        that align economic forces with conservation, and that ex-
        plicitly link human and environmental well-being (1). And this
        promise is flow-ering thanks to substantial recent ad- vances in
        key areas of inquiry, such as ecology, economics, and
        institutions, and their integration (2-5).***"

    -   **Economic perspective**

        -   Incentives and institutions for (economic) investments in
            natural capital.

        -   Design, implementation, and assessment of finance and policy
            mechanisms and systems of governance

        -   Three advances are required:

            1.  the science of ecosystem production functions and
                service mapping (Naidoo et al. 2008)

            2.  the **design of appropriate finance**, policy, and
                governance systems (Tallis et al. 2008)

            3.  the art of implementing these (systems) in diverse
                biophysical and social contexts

    -   \***Title:** "Why arent't contemporary ecologists and
        economicsts addressing resource and energy scarcity: The major
        problems of the 21st century"
    -   **Focus:** Peak oil and indistural civilization (i.e.
        energy-intensive, capitalist, growth-oriented, market-driven
        originally developed in the West).
    -   **Referencing use:**
        1.  Industrial civilization paradigm of the West as the economic
            paradigm that has led to high levels of resource use
            intensities.
        2.  Sustainability-oriented research has not addressed issues of
            population, energy and key resources (e.g. metals).
        3.  Resource issues emerged due to growth in the population and
            in the economy.
        4.  Sustainability science - blind spots in the natural
            sciences.
            -   All too often the idea of sustainability is conflated
                with the idea of "green"
            -   Sustainability cience does not deal with the growth
                paradigm and the energy intensive society
            -   (J. R. Burger et al. 2012) Burger et al 2012 found that
                sustainability research (23,535 published papers) more
                commonly used words like "development" and "economics"
                than "ecology" and "ecological" and even less often
                "thermodynamic" & "steady state".

        5.  Important to remain open about economic paradigms since "the
            success of the neo-classical economic paradigm may have been
            conflated with the access to large amount of high quality
            energy resources and metals\*. E.g. (paraphrasing) even
            communism in the 70's under high degree of resource access
            looked to be an ecnoomically viable strategy.
        6.  Research question: Is neoclassical ecnomics able to deal
            with issues of resource scarcity and population and in
            particular degradation of natural systems.
            -   Gowdy et al. 2004: This is due to a misassessment of the
                role of nature in the economy

                    income
                -   Assuming that natural capital, social (i.e. human)
                    capital, and financial capital are absolute
                    susbstitutes for one another.
    -   **Intro**
    -   Asks question: Why aren't contemporary ecologists and
        economicsts addressing energy and resource scarcity
    -   Claims: Energy and resource scarcity are "the major problems of
        the 21st century"
    -   Intractable problems are caused by - population, resource
        scarcity, impact economy
        -   PSJ: Couldn't this be flipped on its head - the economic
            system is causing resource scarcity?
    -   Problems already identified in the 1950s, 60s, 70s
        -   Scarcity of cheap high-quality energy
    -   The crux: THESE PROBLEMS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY ECOLOGICAL AS THEY
        HAVE TO DO WITH RELATION BETWEEN AN ORGANISM AND ITS ESSENTIAL
        RESOURCES
    -   Observation (unreferenced): Ecologists rarely address resource
        scarcity in a human context

    -   **Mentors/pioneers**
    -   Scholars that pioneered resource scarcity work:
        -   US ecologists - Garrett Hardin, Paul Ehrlich, Eugene Odum
            and Howard Odum, David Pimentel, Kenneth Watt
        -   US economists - Kenneth Boulding, Herman Daly
        -   US computer scientists - Jay Forrester, Dennis Meadows,
            Donnella Meadows
    -   Question: Has technology and market economics solved and
        invalidated the specific and general predictions of the limits
        to growth model?
    -   **After a period of much attention, the issue of humans and
        global resources disappeared from most teachning, research and
        public discourse - ESPECIALLY IN ECOLOGY WAS THIS PERVASIVE**
        -   Claim: Ecologists today are rarely concerned with global
            resource scarcity and are often unaware of global resource
            issues.
        -   Claim (referenced): There has been a movement to marginalize
            poopulation growth
            -   Bartlett 1998 - Social Contract - The massive movement
                to marginalize the modern Malthusian message
    -   Claim: Failure of contemporary thnkers including
        "sustainability" researchers to address energy (oil), resources
        (metals) and population.
        -   This Failure will be known to future generations as "grand
            folly"
    -   *Resource constranist* (Malthusian) references to check out:
        -   HT Odum, "Environment, Power and Society" (1971)
            -   Ecological laws and laws of energy apply to ALL
                organisms
        -   Meadows "Limits to Growth" (1972)
            -   Decline in quality of life and even population size
        -   Hubbert "Energy resources" *in* "Resources and man" (1969)
            -   Peak US (conventional) oil production in 1970
            -   Glbal peak conventional oil production in 2000s (first
                decade of 21st century)
    -   **Resource issues up until early 1970's**
    -   Malthus 1778 considered the first to raise the issue of resource
        constrains
        -   The failure of his prediction due to discovery of oil and
            application to agriculture which allowed food production to
            follow with population growth.
        -   It could be argued that this observations is consistent with
            the human ingenuity, resource substitution and technological
            innovation argument of *Cornucopians*
    -   **Increasing, then vaining interest in resource constraints**
    -   Oil crists of the seventies sparked interest in issues of
        resource constraints
    -   US started importing oil from the Middle East in the 1980's in
        resopnse to oil shortages.
        -   "Economists became leaders in addressing resource issues"
    -   **Turning away from constraintist issues**
    -   Observation (unreferenced): In the 1970's and 1980's ecology
        turned away from human issues and focused on natural
        populations, communities, ecosystems.
        -   PSJ: This must have been a big line and focus of research
            before. So it was a similarly dynamics seen in economics
            where a mainstreaming and decrease in diversity of issues
            and methods took place.
    -   As the population and economy grew, a number of resource issues
        emerged.
        -   Depletion of highest quality fuels
        -   The intellectural bakruptcy of conventional neoclassical
            economics and its inabilities to resolve or even understand
            the issues of depletion
        -   Degradation of natural systems
        -   Loss of goods and services from natural systems
        -   Climate change
        -   (Unsustainable poopulation growth)
    -   **Issues with neo-classical economics**

    -   **Why are ecology and economics not addressing these problems?**
    -   Not because *constrainists* were wrong or because their work was
        not well-known.
    -   Neo-classical economics in becoming the dominant paradigm in
        political economy has decreased the role of resource issues in

    -   Ecologists are no llonger trained to think that resource
        constraints are important or within their puriew
        -   Increasing academic specialization is leading to increasing
            academic fragmentation
        -   Ecologists have taken up residence in biology departments
            -   Ecologists should be among te most integrative and
                interdisiplinary of scientists.
            -   The tenure system discourages young faculty from taking
                on broad, systems oriented problems.
            -   Similar things can be said about funding agencies.
            -   Resource and population problems do not fit comfortably
                within any academic discipline.
    -   The publications that are avaiablel are generally in the form of
        books directed toward broad audiences

        policy community about improved governance as a principal
        mechanism to reduce poverty in Africa rests more on faith than
        science"*

    -   **Economic perspective:**

    -   Poverty reduction mechanisms

    -   Important citation - current economic models do not account for
        large swath of poor that are outside the market (informal
        economy). **The informal economy may be an area that
        sustainability science has done well in tackling, but to make an
        impact it seems it eeds integration with existin economic
        models**. Thus both groups have to approach each other.

    -   Diverging views between social scientists and economists on
        governance (in poverty reduction context)
        -   If sustainability science currently reflects views of one of
            these groups more, then that emphasizes the need for
            integrating the two in sustainability science, thus a need
            for integrating economics as well as other social sciences
            further.
    -   *"Conventional policy models for tackling poverty fail to take
        into account the peculiar socioeconomic and political conditions
        in Africa, where the vast majority of those living on one dollar
        a day or less are only marginally captured by market and state
        institutions and instead rely on solving their problems
        ''outside the system."*

    -   *"Economists continue to dominate the international development
        policy agenda. Another is that political scientists have
        typically looked at how economic variables shape political ones,
        rather than the other way around, as implied in the current
        governance agenda"*

            balances on how governments use their power and distribute
            funding. International policies on transparency and
            financial disclosure can help. Such countries are also prone
            to violent internal conflicts and expanding international
            and regional peacekeeping, and security guarantees could
            help. **Resource-scarce coastal countries** that have missed
            the opportunities to develop Asian-style ex- port-based
            manufacturing will require temporary preferential market
            access. Finally, **countries that are both resource-scarce
            and landlocked** have the least opportunity for growth. They
            will need substantial foreign aid, not for fostering

                current estimates explicitly consider the population,
                the average income per person, the distribution of
                income across the population, and the definition of a
                hunger line of income or its equivalent below which the
                population is thought to be hungry. Similarly, primary
                and secondary school enrollment have been modeled in

                per school-age person, household income, family size,
                and parental education. In this context household income
                is a direct measure of within- country inequality,
                whereas family size and parental education are related
                to inequality one generation prior. Together, these two

        -   Mentions Environmental Kuzets Curve hypothesis and
            altruistic human behavior as one way (though "anecdotal" of
            explaining the curve.

            -   Quote: "*There are also a number of tantalizing,
                although anecdotal, cases that suggest changes in
                consumer preferences can alter future scenarios
                significantly for the better (48, 50). Some of these
                stories are classic examples of the Kuznets hypothesis.
                For example, altruistic consumer willingness to pay a
                premium for shade-grown coffee is reducing pressure for
                certain types of deforestation. Others such as the
                substitution of poultry for beef in the United States
                are driven by self-interested health concerns (51).*"

    -   **Economic perspective**

        -   A macro-perspective on measuring progress in the
            sustainability transition.

            -   Stops short relating back to natural-resource
                consumption per se...
        -   Mentions I=PAT

            -   Kaya identity for CO2 emissions
        -   Suggests a generic relationship to measure aspects of
            development - **D=PAE**

            -   Quote: "*In the case of chronic household hunger,
                current estimates explicitly consider the population,
                the average income per person, the distribution of
                income across the population, and the definition of a
                hunger line of income or its equivalent below which the
                population is thought to be hungry. Similarly, primary
                and secondary school enrollment have been modeled in
                terms of school-age population, national expenditures
                per school-age person, household income, family size,
                and parental education. In this context household income
                is a direct measure of within- country inequality,
                whereas family size and parental education are related
                to inequality one generation prior. Together, these two
                case studies suggest the possibility of a generic
                relationship between development and the interactions
                between the target population (e.g., school-age
                population), affluence (GDP per capita), and equity
                (percent of the relevant population in households above
                an income or entitlement threshold) that can be
                expressed as **D=PAE**.*"
        -   Talks about various **public economic policies** to create
            economic incentives, poverty reduction, tehcnological
            development and provide entitlements.

    -   **Leverage-point perspective**

        -   Identifies leverage-points of intervention for the for
            driving forces of poverty, literacy, health and GHG
            emissions

        -   Identifies one common driver -\> *Population*

            -   Quote: "*The one such variable that is consistent across
                all four cases is population. There is no question that
                the increasing world population makes progress on all
                aspects of sustainability more difficult.*""

            -   Leverage points relating to population - population,
                education (limited by teachers - suggests importing
                teachers), reduction of income inequality by combining
                entitlements and poverty reduction.

            -   Leverage points rerlating to technology. Identifies
                technology as the main leverage point after population.
                That is, it embraces both the Malthusian and cornucopian
                perspectives.

            -   \*\* The most powerful lever of change\*\*

                -   "*Thus perhaps the most powerful lever of change is
                    the concerted willingness of governments, business,
                    and civil society to press ahead with the well
                    understood actions needed to achieve the current

    -   Aim: "*This study develops the criteria for limiting the warming
        below 2 °C, identifies the constraints imposed on policy makers,
        and explores available mitigation avenues. One important
        criterion is that the radiant energy added by human activities
        should not exceed 2.5 (range: 1.7-4) watts per square meter
        (Wm???2) of the Earth's surface.*"

    -   **Economic perspective:**

        -   Decarbonization of the economy through policy and
            technological development (i.e. in essence cornucopian??)

            -   Even if GHG emissions peak in 2015, the radiant energy
                barrier will be exceeded by 100%, requiring simultaneous
                pursuit of three avenues:

                -   1.  reduce the rate of thickening of the blanket by
                        stabilizing CO2 concentration below 441 ppm
                        during this century (**a massive decarbonization
                        of the energy sector is necessary** to
                        accomplish this Herculean task)
                -   1.  ensure that **air pollution laws** that reduce
                        the masking effect of cooling aerosols be made
                        radiant energy-neutral by reductions in black
                        carbon and ozone
                -   1.  thin the blanket by **reducing emissions of
                        short-lived GHGs**.
                -   Quote: "*the four decades we have until 2050 should
                    be exploited to **develop and scale-up revolutionary
                    technologies** to restrict the warming to less than
                    1.5 °C.*"

        reduction

    -   Public sector investment to facilitate poverty reduction through
        private sector savings and investment

        agriculture, health, and infrastructure in rural Africa can be
        overcome through **targeted public-sector investments to raise
        rural productivity** and, thereby, to **increased private-sector
        saving and investments***"

    -   "*In early results, the research villages in Kenya, Ethiopia,

        economic gains are a commendable goal, they are not easy to
        attain*"

        -   "***An analysis of World Bank projects with objectives of
            alleviating poverty and pro- tecting biodiversity revealed
            that only 16% made major progress on both objectives.***"

        win-lose outcomes as a result of how people manage their
        ecosystem services*

    -   "*scientific advances around ecosystem service production
        functions, tradeoffs among multiple ecosystem services, and the

    -   What characterizes succcesful and unsuccesful examples of joint
        biodiversity/ecosystem service conservation and economic growth

    -   The main conclusion in the abstract stops short of specifics,
        but mentions "how people manage ecosystem services" is the
        deciding factor.
