            country to obscure tracking.

        -   Main investors in China are global tax havens.

            -   E.g. Colombia, spraying fields will generate new areas
                with deforestation for coca plantations.

<br><br>

#### Integrating with the core of the socio-economic sciences

-   Deeper integration with economic and social sciences

    -   Going away from individualism, having a more rich view of how
        societies function - corruption - brutality - goodness - norms -
        war & conflict (blind spots - myopias - cognitive disonance -
        understand the world and see the seeds of good) - decision
        making / participatory stuff
-   Advanced economic modelling (maybe not for this paper)

    -   Game theory - Chaos - Buzz Braug -

<br><br>

#### Market dynamics

-   Socio-ecological consequences of financial and market dynamics

    -   The principal agent problem

        -   What are employees evaluated for and what is the goal of the
            institution

-   National bankruptcies - socio-ecological consequences of economic
    shocks

    -   Asian financial crisis

    -   Latin American crises -

        -   Argentina - rangelands

        -   Brazil - forest dynamics

    -   Somalia - cautionary tale of socio-ecological drivers of piracy
        in a economically and democratically collapsed state

<br><br>

#### Future perspectives

-   How can sustainability science go on from here in interacting with a
    broad set of large real world (socio-)economic and financial issues

-   Co-production - what happens when scientists collaborate

    -   Challenges of co-production

    -   How do you think about having socially good processes, without
        being over-normative.

-   Key guideline for what may be considered more controversial bits -
    looking at the empirical side of things
