    * International Finance Corporation (privae sector arm of World Bank Group)

    * As of 2012 IFc requires projects to maintain ecosystem services benefits and to identify those services that the project is directly dependent upon.
    * 78 banks with 70% of global project finance to emerging markets follow the IFC pPerformance Standards

    * Clashes of interest between - shareholder interests (short-term) - company (longer-term) - lenders such as banks (???)
