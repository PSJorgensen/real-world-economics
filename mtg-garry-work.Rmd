#### Integrating with the core of the socio-economic sciences

* Deeper integration with economic and social sciences

    * Going away from individualism, having a more rich view of how societies function - corruption - brutality - goodness - norms - war & conflict (blind spots - myopias - cognitive disonance - understand the world and see the seeds of good) - decision making / participatory stuff


* Advanced economic modelling (maybe not for this paper)

    * Game theory - Chaos - Buzz Braug -
    

<br><br>


#### Market dynamics


* Socio-ecological consequences of financial and market dynamics

    * The principal agent problem
    
        * What are employees evaluated for and what is the goal of the institution
        

* National bankruptcies - socio-ecological consequences of economic shocks

      * Asian financial crisis
      
      * Latin American crises - 
      
          * Argentina - rangelands
          
          * Brazil - forest dynamics

      * Somalia - cautionary tale of socio-ecological drivers of piracy in a economically and democratically collapsed state
      

<br><br>


#### Future perspectives

* How can sustainability science go on from here in interacting with a broad set of large real world (socio-)economic and financial issues

* Co-production - what happens when scientists collaborate

    * Challenges of co-production
    
    * How do you think about having socially good processes, without being over-normative.
    
* Key guideline for what may be considered more controversial bits - looking at the empirical side of things
